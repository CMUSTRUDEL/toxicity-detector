ARKStatsExtractor/cadon/850/447590336,0.12081632653061229,0.08164448,cadon,ARKStatsExtractor,0,"ASB cannot know the wild level exactly, it uses a formula with the taming-effectiveness to determine it, and in most cases this is correct, sometimes it can be off by 1 level. The Tek-species are special in the way that they have 20 % more levels than their vanilla counterparts. Once they are spawned and you can see their level, e.g. with the spyglass, this is the true wild level, which should also be the level that ASB will display. If Tek-creatures are spawned with admin-commands, the levels can be off, as VolatilePulse explained. So if you spawn a Tek creature with a level of 300, it will actually spawn with a level of 360. So most certainly the Tek Rex you posted first, actually has a wild level of 432. If it was spawned with an admin-command and not by the game, probably the special handling of the additional 20 % led to the confusion. In conclusion, the wild-level which ASB shows is the level you can see on the wild dino when it walks around. As soon as admin-commands like  are used, their true wild level is higher, and also ASB will show this higher level. I'm sorry that you feel offended by the additional questions. I can assure you it's not that we don't believe your statements, it's just that ARK handles some things in a way that is not obvious and we also don't know. Sometimes ARK has bugs which produces wrong values like the HP of Troodons, sometimes ARK just behaves strange, like with the levels of Tek species. To find out what is going on in ARK and how things can be fixed in ASB, we need as much information as possible, so some questions may seem not related to the initial question. In this case it's probably important how the creatures are spawned in, i.e. if they spawned naturally in the game or were spawned in by admin-commands. So I ask you to have some patience with additional questions, usually it helps to resolve issues faster the more informations are available. ",0,0.27988699645489323,0.45707482993197285,0,0,0.9689,n

I'm currently doing some research on media streaming servers to integrate live streaming into Funkwhale, the project I'm working on. Ant media server looks like a really good pick for my use cases, but I'm not sure how to ensure viewers cannot hijack a stream. When creating a Stream in the interface, you can  Copy the RTMP publish url, like rtmp//localhost/LiveApp/499481361945988697107161,  being the Stream ID Copy the player embbed code, like ,  being the stream ID, the same one as in the publish URL  Since the Stream ID is used for publishing purposes, but also shared with viewers, my understanding is that any viewer can easily guess the publish URL by inspecting the player source and potentially hijack a stream. I may be completely wrong or missing something, but I'd like to double check that with you. Is this normal behaviour? Is there another way to achieve what I need (having a non guessable rmtp publishing link)? I can see that there is another issue linked to authentication ( but my idea was that providing a different, non guessable URL (with a different ID, but binded to the same stream) for viewing / publishing. Let me know if you need additional info, and thank you for the incredible work! ",1,0.9316078602186635,0.5395424836601307,0,0,0.9563,n

I understand that people need to earn a living, hence the community/enterprise edition split. However, in most if not all projects, the community edition implement the core features that are absolutely mandatory, while the enterprise edition add extra features that are needed for more advanced use cases or bigger installations. The way I understand it, a basic media streaming server allows  One user to publish a stream Everyone to receive a stream  Item 1 is simply not available in the community edition, since everyone can actually publish on any stream. In some cases, additional security is an extra feature, but that's not true here having an even basic restriction on who can publish on a given stream is part of the core use case. Without that, the software is actually dangerous to use for any real-world stream! Let me take a concrete example showing how bad it could be. Alice has a video game a stream on an Ant Media Server (Community edition), with some young viewers in the audience. Alice's streams are completely safe for any audience. But one day, for fun, someone decides to hijack Alice's stream and broadcast porn instead. They can do that in literally 1 minute, by simply examining the Stream URL in the page source and firing up OBS. Alice looses her audience, reputation, and can even be sued by angry parents. Knowing that publishing is left completely open, I don't understand why anyone would use the Community edition of Ant Media. The attack surface and risks are just too big. I sincerely think publishing should be protected by default in the community edition, and I hope that you'll consider that for the safety of viewers and streamers on your platform.

Did you consider the security risks associated with the current state of your software? If all Community Edition deployments and Enterprise Edition streams that do not use the Token Control feature are vulnerable to stream hijacking, I believe you have a responsability to fix that. Your current stance is ""our software is insecure, but you can enable a paid option to make it secure"". And even when paying, the token thing is still optional! That's simply not acceptable, especially since you're not advertising this huge security risk anywhere. We're not talking about enhanced, nice-to-have security here (like with two-factor authentication which could be a paid option only), it's about basic, indispensable security for publishers and viewers! Thank you for the code samples, but there is no point in implementing a workaround to secure your software if you're not planning to secure it yourself in the end.

First of all Community edition provides more and more features even includes some enterprise features and used by lots of developers in the community. Using unique stream id both for streaming and playing is just about implementation example and you can manage other things on your application level based on this open-source project. I also gave an example about how you can change output name of streaming files that you will give to users. Therefore changing these names, users can not reach your stream (Alice's stream ) URL and you do not have any security threat at this point. To make it clear, One-time token implementation is developed for only limiting audience not for fixing a security issue. To sum up, Ant Media Server Community Edition is totally open source software and you can develop your application based on that, during these phases, you can change the structure, way of operation etc. Sure for them, you can get support, documentation etc every time.

Honestly, Contentify cannot reach the same high quality level as for example WordPress. WP has a huge community and lots of contributors plus a strong commercial background. None of these is true for Contentify. Therefore, it has no ads ad all, nowhere at all (except of some recommendations which do not generate any money). It does not spy on you or restrict you. DSVGO / GDPR...  If this really is something that interests you, let me ensure you, the only thing you have to worry about is the use of Google Analytics on the contentify.org website. That's the only ""evil"" third party software that is in use. And on our side, we do collect very (extremely?) few client data and we do very (rarely / almost none) analysis of the collected data.

Handbrake encodes less than 10%, shows a green SUCCESSFUL finish in queue as shown here (last on the list)  And the end of encode log as src/libbluray/bluray.c696 Skipping broken unit at 6708854784 [040357] reader done. 1 scr changes ♠` As a test, which has only upset me more, when I run this source media through multiple other encoder/video tools that even just copy the streams, literally every one but Handbrake quickly return errors like this (MakeMKV identified source as bad within 2 min into stream RIP and gave a very clear indication there was a problem with source)  With HB the result of this reported successful encode job is ultimately a truncated 21 minute BAD video file - accompanied with two thumbs up from Handbrake.  I do not nor ever have expected Handbrake to work any magic with a bad source, but any encoder should at least know when it has failed due to having a bad source, and in such until now I thought had been properly returning the job as failed on a bad source.  My HUGE concern now is as it stands that I have to go back and hand-parse EVERY encode log and watch every video to determine if the job was truly a success because, had this one instead been a 98% complete encode, seeing ""success"" in both the GUI and looking at the end of the the log for failure (which I would never usually even do unless the job showed as failed) I would have never caught the failure and simply moved it to my library and then wondered why parts either stuttered or did not play at all or in this case, the movie just stopped prematurely.  And given this example and depending on how long this bug has been in place, I'm sure it has already occurred for me and this is going to become VERY time-consuming to hand-parse logs or re-run my media through other tools to verify source media was readable or not. Parsing this known bad encode log for the word ""errors"" renders exactly twelve lines ending in ""errors""....and all twelve have ZERO before the word errors.  I can't stress enough how big of an issue this is. With all that said, if possible to nail it down, I would be interested in knowing how long this issue has existed so I can have an idea of just how long I have to back-trace my encodes and manually review all logs to ensure I don't have not yet watched bad encodes (that HB returned as good) now sitting in my media folders.  Also, is parsing for ""skipping broken unit"" in bad HB versions the best/only way to truly determine when an otherwise successful returned job was really a failure due to bad source media?  TIA!

MakeMKV might have recorded more about the nature of the flaw it ITS log, but that's speculation about facts not in evidence.

They'll have a ton of code to handle the thousands of scenarios that now come up and change with every new disc released.   Much in the same way we recommend running stream repair tools before dealing with OTA recordings in HandBrake. There are tools specialised just to that file type. As far as HandBrake can tell, there isn't a problem here so it did the correct thing in not failing the encode. The error here isn't fatal and won't always result in a failed encode. I reckon, if we flagged every decoder error we see, we'd see a 60+% failure rate on encodes across millions of users.  That's never going to end well for anyone, especially when a large percentage of those won't actually have resulted in failed encodes.  So, our options are actually very limited. Unfortunately, looking at the logs is not sufficient to tell if you have good encodes. No matter what software you use, the only way to be sure is to watch the entire file and pay very close attention to it.  Same with MakeMKV.

I'd like to propose bringing it to the official HandBrake UI. I think of the encoding process in three main phases 1) How. How should the file be encoded? What container do we want? What size display are we targeting? How many channels of audio do we need? Does it support anamorphic? What audio and video decoders are supported on the playback device? A user might just pick a preset, or they might go in and set it up manually. Typically you can set this up once and re use it, maybe with minor tweaks across many sources. 2) What. What sources are we encoding? Did we load the right source? Which angle do we pick, what audio and subtitle streams do we include? Do we want only audio or do we want subtitles? What are the chapters named? 3) When. When will we be done? What items are in the queue? How is the encode going? A user will go through steps 2 and 3 many times when encoding multiple files. This is the standard core workflow for transcoding video. The core workflow is here in the current HandBrake UI  Picking what you want to encode involves a journey between 3 different tabs. All of the data is mixed in with the complex ""how"" of encoding that is not relevant to the core workflow. To check what you've already queued up or to monitor the encode, you need to explicitly open a separate window. To streamline this, I put the core workflow into the main window. This allows more real estate to be devoted to helping you get through the common, routine processing steps  Load the source, then you get everything at a glance, immediately editable. If there's not enough room, the sections collapse, showing as much as possible without scrolling. Queue up items and start the encode and the progress/queue is immediately visible. Decoupling the source data and the encoding settings gives you another advantage you can edit the encoding settings without needing a source open. The source area can have an ""open"" UI on it, rather than a bunch of grayed out boxes  I do remember a few objections to this kind of approach when I first suggested it in 2010 But what if I like to tweak encoding settings for every source? That's still possible. The encoding settings window opens beside the main window and stays open on relaunching. It's not modal so it doesn't put up any roadblocks to immediate tweaking. But it doesn't make sense to edit encoding settings without a source loaded. I have not heard of any practical problems or user confusion in 8 years. The approach seems to be working well. But if people batch process, some of the files might come out wrong and people will be angry. This has never happened. People really like the batch processing. There have also been a lot of changes since the initial prototype UI. I've also heard the sentiment that HandBrake and VidCoder are two separate projects meant for different purposes. I don't think that's true at all; I believe firmly that the same software can serve all the use cases of anyone who might like either. It's just a matter of getting there. VidCoder is missing some functionality from HandBrake and has its share of issues and incompatibilities, but I don't think it's anything we can't work out. Let me know what you think.

There are often multiple ways to approach things, and yours may be fine for your user base. It simply isn't a direction we want to take the HandBrake UI. The main comments I would like to make pertain to your premise and the core workflow. The how/what/when idiom again may make sense for you and your users. This is vastly different from how we approach the HandBrake UI. Our core workflow has evolved over the years, and while I'm not one to take a ton of credit, I have been investing quite a bit of thought and design into improving stress areas over time while accommodating new objectives and the features that support them. We've approached things from a realignment perspective (iterative improvements), rather than a complete redesign, and there are more improvements in the pipeline that wouldn't be easily accommodated by your design. Consider for example the proposed dimensions overhaul and plethora of color space/depth related updates we will need to implement before long. Video filters are also more popular than people realize, and more are planned along with better presentation thereof as I/we have time. The current core workflow is probably best explained by the Quick start article. In short, open a source, select a preset, hit start. That mostly leaves ""where did it go?"" and we've improved the destination controls and documentation to help with that, too. The result is that normal humans are more able to successfully use HandBrake now than ever before. I talk to regular people using HandBrake all the time (both in passing and for research purposes) and their experiences support this. So does my stopwatch. The rest of the UI is then what the presets system sets on behalf of the user. While these tabs/controls could be hidden completely (ala Instant HandBrake of years past), they provide no obstacle these days. We've disabled most unnecessary controls on startup and presented the summary tab as an excellent at-a-glance description of what will happen. The team has worked to achieve a hybrid beginner/pro UI design that only reveals more as you desire to go deeper, and I'm very proud of that. So we've solved very specific sticking points for millions of people with the current iteration. I and others continue to do research and design to iteratively improve the existing flow. Your design addresses a completely different set of concerns, so in some ways, we're comparing apples to oranges. While some comparisons can be made, there is no ""best"". The HandBrake UI is on a proven, successful path, and yours is a departure from that path. I don't believe it addresses many of the issues we had, currently have, and plan to improve. If it works for VidCoder, great! I have no doubt this is a useful paradigm for some people. That HandBrake is going a different direction hopefully will not discourage you from continuing to iterate and improve for your audience. ",0,0.6231775243923467,0.5191888944388945,0,0,0.9952,n

Please try to look at it objectively and not as an attack on anybody or any work that's been done. As for the dimensions overhaul, I've already done it.

Before the changes these all had perfectly usable interfaces with lots of incremental improvements and no specific issue that required the change.

If it helps, you can look at VidCoder as the ""prototype"". Play around with it and see if the idea could work in HandBrake. I don't expect buy-in without discussion. I would like to hear why you think this idea is incompatible with your future plans. In any event, I'm not complaining to you about having to spend all this work on changes you're not implementing. I'm not sorry I went and built my own UI because hundreds of thousands of people have used it, people have thanked me for it on a regular basis, and I'm darn proud of it. I'm here asking for a discussion because I realized we really do have the same goals and working together we could make something much better. And because what's in the past doesn't really matter, just how we can make the software better in the future. ",0,0.5961904234750232,0.4524572649572649,0,0,0.9759,n

As a navigator I was always taught 'don't issue an instruction unless it's to change road', and as a driver I completely understand that.  Especially on a motorway, being told every mile or two 'keep right' gets very old very quickly.  I'd rather be told the distance to the point at which I would leave the road I am currently on, and instructions issued for that point only. Also, it seems arbitrary when the 'keep right/left' instruction is actually called - not sure if that's an OSMand issue or something to with the nodes in the OSM data itself. Any chance we can have this as an option? Also, the instruction 'turn slightly right' can be very ambiguous at junctions.  In line with what I mentioned above, I think for clarity having the option to just say 'turn left' or 'turn right' to indicate leaving the current road and moving on to a new road, irrespective of the severity of the turn, would reduce any confusion.  That way the driving instructions aren't overly verbose - they are clear and concise.  Of course I understand that other people might be used to having such verbosity from other driving aids, which is why I'm suggesting making them optional.

So I assume that ""false"" announcements may happen where a road forks, and both forks are a slight turn. While driving on one of them, you may perceive this as 'going straight', but looking at an aerial view, you may realize you take one of 2 slightly bent forks legs. I do think we factor in the hierarchy of roads, so this will probably not occur if you are and stay on a primary road, and an unused trail forks in one of its turns. But I am not sure if it may happen in certain forks between a motorway and a motorway link.

NZ rules would be roughly equivalent to Tromp-Taylor, as far as I know, just FYI), which defines the assumed overall rule set for the SGF.

As for the option to toggle scoring, it is definitely not obvious in the UI. I looked for it before posting this, although I was looking for changing the rule set, not for 'area vs. territory'. I'll look again.... Okay, that is definitely not obvious. Instead of being under Preferences or Game Info, you have to click on the score display within Score or Estimate, and the score certainly does not appear to be a button of any kind at first glance. Personally, I would try to follow the principles laid out in The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman, a very well-known design and usability researcher. For example, one of his principles is that a single control on an interface should ideally have a single function the score display violates this principle by acting as both a simple display and as a button, with no additional visual affordance to indicate that it might be a button (although mouse hovering does indicate this, but who would think to hover over the score display? I didn't, until prompted by your comment). Compare this with a hyperlink, which is also a clickable display object, but which provides the visual affordances of being a different colour to the surrounding text and is also usually with an adornment such as being underlined.

Previously, the button would only display 'Done', but I changed it so it would display useful information instead of just being a waste of space. Also, the data for both area and territory are visible, just the end result changes when you toggle between them. I agree there is a property for specifying the ruleset, but it shouldn't have an effect on someone who edits the game. That's what I meant by 'no concept'.

I'm referring to the score display control that shows up when you do Estimate, and it shows, for example, something like ""W+50.5"", and when you hover over it, it says ""Details"". Clicking on that control/button brings you to the Score calculation dialog where you can finally select Area or Territory. It's this dual-purpose control that both displays the score and is also a Details button that I'm referring to. It doesn't sound the same as the Done button you're referring to. Just for reference, other Go UIs such as the WGo UI display both territory and area scoring when you select Count Score from its hamburger menu. The real issue here is that I was opening SGF files which had their RU tag set to 'Chinese', but Sabaki was showing scoring based on territory/Japanese, rather than area/Chinese. If the scoring defaulted to area for 'Chinese', and territory for 'Japanese', that would be better, IMO. Unless they are opening multiple SGF files, in which case, the users would expect that the 'score' should be based on the ruleset specified by the existing SGF. Games from different sources, or even the same source (such as OGS), can use different rulesets from one game to the next. If the user has to open up the SGF file in a text editor to discover what the ruleset is, and then locate the difficult-to-find Details/Score calculation dialog just to toggle to the right scoring method, that's a pretty big pain in the UI. Sabaki can easily figure out which scoring should be default and toggle to that. Or, alternatively, just show both scoring methods, each on its own line, when the user clicks Estimate. Presumably, it also specifies how the score in the game result property was calculated. ",0,0.8263157366617662,0.4027425044091711,0,0,0.8124,n

My argument still stands if you change one wording for another. I did indeed miss this, but please do explain yourself further. That's exactly the button I'm referring to. No contradictions here. And I think WGo can be customized either way. I'm not a fan of how opening an SGF file can change a user's setting. Also, if the score has already been calculated, there is no need to calculate it again with the scoring tool. This is actually a good idea. ",0,0.35214844838081827,0.48194444444444445,0,0,-0.6742,n

Obviously, I didn't suggest for you to read it just for me. In fact, I didn't even suggest for you to read it at all. I simply referenced it by link so that you'd know what book I was referring to. If you were to read it, it would be for your own sake, obviously, not mine. I don't suggest people do things just for me in the first place. If I didn't care about the success of this project at some level, I wouldn't have posted anything here at all. It takes time and effort to write an Issue report and follow up on the comment thread. There are plenty of other things I could spend my time and effort on. I chose to contribute to this project rather than some other. You needn't have had to. I'm just explaining how I know about the book and what field it is typically associated with (though it's even more general than HCI). You seemed to be wondering why I referenced a 15-30 year old book. Hence, I explained why. But all of that is kind of irrelevant as to whether or not to support different Go rule sets, or how to make the scoring mode more accessible and usable. It's just background information. Actually, regarding whether I quoted the book or referenced it from memory, I'm not exactly sure what your argument is, to be honest. What would it matter either way? Not sure what else to say. Right now it has a single line saying Just make it two lines Okay then, that's the button that has two functions, and one of them is not obvious (being the Details button where scoring mode toggling is hidden). That's the button I'm suggesting to either  1) Make it two controls, a Score display, and a separate Details button, or  2) Make it more obvious it's a button by adding visual affordances to it, such as by making it a hyperlink instead, or  3) Don't hide the scoring method toggle inside it; instead put the scoring method toggle in Preferences or Game Info, or  4) Partially eliminate the need for a scoring method toggle by showing both area and territory scoring on the same panel, as above, or  5) Something else if you prefer. I wasn't pointing out a contradiction, I was giving an example of another Go UI that already partially eliminates the need for a scoring method toggle by simply showing both scoring methods simultaneously, as above, suggestion 4. I disagree with your assumption that the scoring method is a property of the user's settings. IMHO, it should be a property of the game's settings. Therefore, it can and should be different depending on the SGF file, because that's where the scoring method (i.e. rule set) is specified. IMHO. Maybe the user's settings could include a 'default scoring method' for when they make a new game from scratch, but when loading existing games, which used pre-determined (i.e. before the game even began) scoring methods, I think the UI should reflect the game's settings primarily, and the user's settings should only be a default, if the game has no rule set specified. IMHO, of course. (Just assume I have 'IMHO' tacked on at the end of each sentence.) I'm not sure what this is referring to. Perhaps you mean the final game result? Thanks, but it's not really my idea. It's Don Norman's (or rather, I got it from his book; he probably learned it somewhere else, I'm guessing), namely the principle that each user control should have only one obvious function -- the corollary being that if you need to put in two functions, put in two separate controls. It's not a 100% all the time thing, it's just a principle. But a good one. From a time-tested book by a well-known researcher and engineer. (In case you were wondering where I got it from. Whether you read it or not is not my concern.) ",0,0.9795307967498417,0.48195829468150897,0,0,0.7131,n

Also, if the score has already been calculated, there is no need to calculate it again with the scoring tool.  Not sure what else to say. Scoring the game only makes actual sense if it is your own game, since finished SGF files already have the score in its result field. One can take an SGF file and start playing from somewhere in the middle with an engine and score the game their way.  I think the best way to avoid the double concern is to let the button show 'Details' and have another label to show the score for those who don't realize the 'visual affordance' I put into the button. In any case, I wanted some good reasoning to do something, not just a quote or a reference or whatever to a 'well-known researcher'. Controls which have more than one function are quite common nowadays. It's a great way to provide functionality without cluttering the UI.

I suspect that you have gotten so familiar with the pack that you don't even think about the experience of a new player. The most important player you have is the new player. If you do not get new players, you wind up with a declining population and eventual nothingness; additionally, new players recruit other new players. As a new player, this is what I have seen, that really seems to define the pack for me Go to a kitchen counter (you can do this as a thought experiment if you want), and clear a meter square surface. Use some tissue paper (or toilet paper), and divide it into 1' x 1' squares. Stand in front of it. Now, keeping your eyes straightforward, move your neck to where you are looking around at all 9 spaces. Notice how much head movement you have, notice how much work is involved. Now, just look at the whole table, and move your hand around all 9 spaces. Notice how much easier it is? This is without taking into account that the mouse movements needed to aim where you are looking at for the 3 spaces closest to you are actually much more exaggerated than for the others. An ""in-world crafting table"", or ""non-GUI interface"" is not ""more realistic"". It is denying the use of hands to do things. It is taking the worst choices of the interface and controls of Minecraft and magnifying their effect. And it completely eliminates the concept of saying, ""I'm focusing on the crafting table, I'm using my hands to place things on the table, and I'm going to look things up in the recipe book"". Good or bad, you have basically chosen to document the modpack and its recipes with JEI. And that documentation is lost as soon as you are using the work stump. The mod page for primal tech (work stump mod) claims that it has JEI support. Yet I don't see it in play. Now, let's look at these work stump, wooden hopper, chest, shelf (cupboard), water strainer. The basic operations on stores of inventory items are deposit one, deposit stack, remove stack, remove one, remove half stack. The documentation for what key/mouse commands do what is nonexistent. Each block seems to have a slightly different set of controls than the other blocks, and none of them are documented. If you make a mistake with the water strainer (taking out too much), you can't put the others back. If you try to take one repeatedly from either the wooden hopper, the chest, or the shelf you wind up placing the block that you just took out (because the control used is shift-place). Etc. (and why does the water strainer have an inventory GUI when nothing else at this tech level does?). ""Nonintuitive"" only begins to describe the pain of this system. I haven't even gotten to the strangeness of saying that there is an item you can craft at tech level tutorial that includes an item you can't understand, that can be made ""in hand"" in your 2 x 2 but not on the work stump. All of these ""in world"" non-GUI blocks essentially restrict you to only those items that you have room for in your hot bar. None of the rest of your inventory space is usable. My hot bar is almost always nearly full in normal play, and even so far in the pack I don't have much space in it. I want to bring up the issue of the chopping block again. I complained about the behavior of the chopping block. I was told, ""You tap attack on the chopping block..... stop wasting our time with these issues use discord...."". Nowhere in the documentation that I saw -- not the pages for the mods, not any instruction in the achievement tree, no tooltips for the chopping block, nothing -- is the ""tap attack"" mentioned. And this is so much in line with everything else in Minecraft, that you see this tap attack used ... to pick up mine carts. And I think only to pick up mine carts. It isn't the norm, I am used to other mods that distinguish between your activities based on where you are pointing at -- heck, vanilla will rely on where you are aiming when it comes to placing stairs or slabs -- and to have my ""bug report"" (and the behavior did seem very buggy and exceedingly nonobvious) dismissed and closed with that remark seems very much ""anti-new player"". And ""stop wasting our time""? Do you have any idea how much time I have been spending trying to find something worth playing in this pack? Do you have any idea how much time I'm spending reporting the problems and flaws I'm running into as a new player? Do you have any idea how much time anyone else that tries to pick up this pack is going to spend trying to deal with the interface strangeness? My observation so far is that while there appeared to be a very large amount of things to do in tech level tutorial, the reality is that the arrangement of the achievements is highly misleading, and tech level tutorial is really tiny; most of it is actually tech level 0. But even in zero, while there appears to be many things to do, all that really matters is the ""advanced to the next tech level"" path. Let me repeat that I am being trained, early in the game, that all that matters is advancing to the next tech level, and everything else at any given stage of the game is pointless. You have gone to a great deal of effort to make these tech levels, put content in them, and all I am learning is to skip them as quickly as possible. That's just bad. I like the idea of a detailed progression pack, complete with an actually complete progression chart. The last time I saw something like this was Jaded's packs. (My only exposure to non-vanilla skyblock was agrarian skies, and an entire section of her quest lines was a chapter on how to skyblock.). I have tried playing other quest packs that did not actually have enough information in the quest lines that you'd have any idea what you were actually trying to do or how to do it. I really do appreciate the large amount of effort (and having tried to make a quest pack once myself, I do mean that I recognize and appreciate the large amount of effort). I have been told by my friends -- both the one who encouraged the rest of us to play this, and the other one that has gone crazy with the musical ceremonies -- that the pack gets much more interesting once I get to the musical ceremonies. I've even discovered that there is a bit of balance issue -- a single person trying to generate enough music by themselves will have trouble on some of the more complicated ceremonies, but 4 people playing music together will find that all of them are trivial. I like the idea of being required to learn mods that I normally do not use -- because there actually is an in game training for these mods, which is usually the point missing from most mods. But if there is no reason to stay around at a given tech level, if the goal that I am learning is ""just advance to the next tech level, and get access to better, more advanced and more powerful mods"", then why? Would I recommend this pack to anybody else? Not based on what I've seen so far. Why am I trying to continue playing this pack? Only because I have 3 friends at tech level 2, and they are waiting for me to catch up so we can play together. And I'm going to ask them to put a standard chest, and a standard crafting table in my room so that I can at least reduce the amount of pain that I have while playing (and I'm going to take advantage of the fact that they already have a horse powered chopping block set up so that I never have to worry about that tap attack issue again). Or, you know, just rely on the fact that I have a water strainer to give me all the planks I need. How does that make any sense anyways? ",0,0.3822351555814502,0.4388624440531221,0,0,-0.9339,y

If you felt hurt by that then you need to understand that we're not going to spoon feed users on this tracker on how to do x or y. A lot of modpacks use new mods or mods which change mechanics which do lack documentation. But this is why those packs have Reddit's or Discord or even Forums where the community creates the documentation. One big example being this  like this was all done by the community.

I had plenty of instances where how to do something simple wasn't detailed anywhere in SevTech, and I find myself constantly googling things from specific mods in order to use them. Most recent example would be making stabilized metal with an arc furnace. JEI only says I needed a hardened mesh, iron, and some refined hardeners. All JEI showed was that I needed all three in the same place, but it turns out the refined hardeners needed to be in the modifiers slots along with the iron ingots. Never would I have guessed that iron ingots were NOT what was being melted down to make stabilized metal, and instead were put in the modifiers slots instead of the smelting spots. I spent over an hour and a half pulling my hair out. Google was of little help this time because the recipe is different in SevTech than what it showed elsewhere and I had to eventually just rummage through random youtube videos concerning steve's carts until I noticed one from a streamer involved an arc furnace, and surprise surprise he spent almost half an hour on the stream trying to figure out how to make stabilized metal. Only when he eventually discovered iron ingots needed to be on the right slots instead of the left in the arc furnace was I then also able to continue with it myself. There's like, probably a dozen examples of SevTech progression-related advancements where it just says ""do this thing with this mod"" but it doesn't tell you how, or always give you that mod book. There's a few books from mods that you have to craft in order to try and learn about that mod. It doesn't help that SevTech starts off by giving you these books when you reach those points for free, and then stops entirely leading the player to believe there IS no book to help with that mod when in fact there is, you just need to browse JEI until you find it and craft it.  There's a lot to complain about in terms of SevTech teaching players what to do. Not just in the first two ages either. I'm in age 4 and pausing the game to go spend half an hour googling information that isn't obvious or clear to me in order to progress or acquire something exceedingly valuable is simply par for the course at this point. I've gotten used to it and I never thought about how stupid it was. It do in fact hate games that make me stop playing them in order to figure out how to continue playing them. A modpack for a game like Minecraft was probably always going to entail this, though. As for the I actually disagree. All those extra advancements are more a quality-of-life thing. They are pointless in the same vein that the mushroom islands or woodland mansions are pointless in vanilla minecraft. If you consider defeating the Ender Dragon and watching the end credits to be the ultimate goal, then there's an ENORMOUS amount of stuff in vanilla miencraft that's pointless, and only there if you want it or find it fun to invest your time into. SevTech does this but on steroids. I've skipped kitten kaboodles of advancements because they didn't interest me. Literally never even touched Steve's Carts. Didn't even make a cart or use any of the mod at all. Only acquired stabilized metal to get a mob duplicator for my mob farm.  I think that's fine. It allows you to select what you want to do, and only rarely forces you into mundane or tedious vague bullshit as a requirement to progress OCCASIONALLY.  For the most part, the age-progression content is straightforward enough. There's nothing wrong with focusing on ONLY the age progressions. I for one played that way intentionally for a good while, thinking once I had enough stuff unlocked, I'd simply come back and browse what I wanted, getting it later, which is in fact now what I'm doing; building a massive sky castle that will have absolutely everything I could possibly want or need now that the majority of SevTech and its mod contents are available to me.  If you were hoping for progression where you only advance after doing 100% of everything in that age, I would argue you don't know what you're asking for, because during age 0 and 1, I thought that's what I had to do (again because SevTech never told me that age progression advancements had a unique shape to their advancement icons) and it was a tedious nightmare doing this and finding that and completing something I cared nothing for just to try and continue. Overall SevTech isn't really good for player's who aren't already at least relatively familiar with a large handful of mods. It requires homework outside of the game in order to keep going further, yes. I don't like it much either in that manner. It's more a serious of mods strung together with the idea of one unlocking the next, rather than something that was delicately crafted to provide the player the complete and total experience from several of the best mods available in the pack in as smooth and convenient a way as possible.

Identified in a Forge pull request as mods doing the equivalent of a graphic state push, alteration, and no balancing graphics state pop.

Now fixable with a Forge upgrade. (Entirely separate we are warned not to try to upgrade Forge ourself in this pack, because that will break something else). Flint not flaking every single time. Turns out this is apparently expected. Not every attempt to make a flake gets a roll, and you won't always succeed at your attempt. So you have to attempt multiple times, and you're going to have losses. This is not documented, but is expected behavior. A complaint about how items that you pick up off the ground go into your hot bar, and then get dropped as you move your mouse wheel. ""Works as intended"".

And in this thread, you made it clear that you thought I was asking for support. Not reporting problems. Please take a look at what I have written here tonight. Do you see how a new player, who has never seen this pack before, and is trying to play it through, is going to get very discouraged very quickly? ""That and most of them are Discord issues. This tracker is for bug reports and mod suggestions"" -- WHICH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE IS. Discord is a horrible support tool. Compared to forums, Discord is a horrible support tool. There is effectively no history. There is no way to have any type of ongoing discussion about a topic. There is no way for people to comment on the same topic a day later, and be read and understood by somebody a week later. There is next to no ""pinned topic"" feature like there is in forums. You can pin single messages, but there's no way to respond to them. There is zero expectation that messages posted in Discord will be seen by anybody with the ability to deal with it. High-volume, high noise level, low signal-to-noise value, no organization, and nothing keeping track of what an administrator has/has not yet read, at least nowhere near the degree to which a forum does. ""We're not going to waste our own time when working on the pack and then deal with issues which no effort was put into them or could have been dealt with in Disord."" No effort? No Effort? NO EFFORT? Every single issue that I reported, excluding only the flint flaking, I mentioned how to work around the problem that I found. With flint flaking, there was no workaround because the only problem was the documentation. You complain that I don't put any time into this? I do. You complain that I don't make any effort to solve the problems on my own? I do. More than anything else, it is this dismissal that infuriates me. But none of this is the real problem. Let me restate that. TL; DR none of this is the real problem. ""But to be clear this pack was designed for Sevadus. It's designed around him and how he wanted it. Nothing will change in regards to the advancements or layout. It's done to a spec which we met."" This is the real issue. Do you not see it? Then let me spell it out. Sevadus is the one who has to approve changes. That means any issues with the modpack ultimately need to go to him. Not to you. Trying to report any issue to you is pointless; the only one that matters is somebody who isn't even here, doesn't read these reports, doesn't get reports sent upstream to him from you for his comments, and is completely out of the loop. So why is this issues thing even here? Why do you have an issues section on this GitHub, when ultimately you can't actually do anything? When you just want us to use discord? "" It doesn't help that SevTech starts off by giving you these books when you reach those points for free, and then stops entirely leading the player to believe there IS no book ..."". Well, no apparently, the first person on a server to reach an age where there is a book will get the books for free. Other players don't, and if they aren't aware that the mod has a book, they are clueless. Even worse, imagine seeing a whole bunch of new things show up in your achievements, and not seeing anything at all about backpacks. Absolutely no clue that backpacks have opened up for you. In a modpack that basically triples the number of items that there are to collect. That you need. When your chest/storage space ability has been crippled. ""I'm in age 4 and pausing the game to go spend half an hour googling information that isn't obvious or clear to me in order to progress or acquire something exceedingly valuable is simply par for the course at this point. I've gotten used to it and I never thought about how stupid it was. "". Isn't this basically the point of a quest line? Sorry, an achievement line? I was ready to give up on this completely. My friends basically apologized for rushing through, and rushing ahead so quickly. One of them got to age 3 in a solo world, (during her time off from medical school), and introduced this pack to the rest of us. Another got to age 2 in a solo world in something like 10 days. (As he says, he has no life). The 2 of them worked together with the 3rd person, and they all got at least half way through age 0 during the first week of part-time play while I was still trying to connect my own machine. I tried to progress on my own, trying to catch up with them. By the next weekend? The one with no life had split off from the rest of the group, made his own base, and advanced to age 1. I was struggling with basics. By the end of that weekend, no life was up to age 2, everyone else was up to age 1, we had a teleport network built between our bases, I was trying to make string (and at this point I don't even remember what it was that I needed the string for), and was trying to put down enough torches to safely light up our area, only to realize that instead of one block of wood making 8 sticks making 32 torches, one block of wood might make 6 sticks which makes 2 torches. And a mass of giant trees took more than 3 work blades to de-leaf (because you get more sticks from work blade de-leafing than you do from decay), absolute full of pain and anguish, taking a massive amount of time, and only later do we discover that there's apparently a tool in age 0 that takes the leaves off of a large area of trees in almost no time. If it was just me, I'd already be gone. My friends have convinced me that the pack isn't quite so bad if you have someone to lead you through it, and the other comments in this thread tell me that other people need to be led through it. So the quest line/achievement lines are not sufficient, and the person who made this pack is happy with that. That stinks. I'll probably make videos of my play through and learning, with the goal of being a ""how-to"" for the people who come after me, because this pack badly needs it.

Definitely everything SevTech is about. It's a Minecraft-themed Homework Simulator.  When I was getting through age 3, I was making a bee-line for the age advancements to breach age 4, hoping blindly it would unlock diamonds by age 4 because why in the world would diamonds be exclusive to an age that prioritizes space travel? How are diamonds more valuable than literal rocket-science?  I wanted them because in the Cyclic book, I read about diamond spikes, which were the first item I discovered that apparently would act as a player-kill. Already having a small, rather inefficient mob farm built by that point, all I wanted were those diamond spikes so I could turn my mob farm into an experience farm as well. Come age 4 after some grueling and nightmare-ish progression grinding and googling and video watching and building and rebuilding when I realize I built it wrong and all the hullabaloo that comes with stupidly vague SevTech progression... I discover diamonds are in fact age 5 not 4, but browsing through JEI, I noticed mob grinding utils is now unlocked... which comes with mob-killing items that drop experience, and dark utilities now has a ""player trap"" which does the same thing as diamond spikes.  My ultimate goal was wisped away from me due to lack of SevTech information, and then immediately returned to me through another avenue via lack of SevTech information.  This is unfortunately how the whole experience is, honestly. You will have a suckish time if you don't constantly browse and research what is newly available. SevTech seriously seriously VERY EXTREMELY BADLY NEEDS a feature where it lists to you all the items unlocked by age, and also provide links to resources players will end up likely googling anyway just to try and learn more about a mod they are using. Since SevTech has so many mods, it needs to compensate for this massive overflowing incline of a learning curve it now results in, and provide players something more comprehensive.  Something to list what each age unlocks (only available after you reach that specific age). Way more detail about where to find more information concerning a mod (I.E. does the mod have a book the player can craft? Or should they default to googling and thus be provided a link from an in-game description instead?). SevTech is very anti-player-friendly.  Though to be honest, apathetic-looking github management and poor/nonexistent in-game teaching methods aside... I just want the damn modpack to work again. Seriously, whatever happened with the 3.0.8 update has made it so incredibly unfun to play SevTech with how unstable it is now that I may not ever have the motivation to actually make it to age 5.  Literally a complete rollback to 3.0.7 would be 100% acceptable to me at this point, because at least the modpack can be played in a heavy setting again, such as large builds or complicated surroundings (which, you know... age 4 and 5 will basically demand from the player anyway). Unfortunately, we may just be barking at a bush from the perspective of the people involved in sevtech development. If it was made primarily to meet a specific guy's standards, I doubt anybody but him coming forward and saying ""shit needs a lot of work, yo"" is gonna do anything besides fall on deaf ears.

Most of this complaining is stupid.  You're complaining about lack of documentation, that is the Forge/Modded world in general.

Maps where you start with essentially one sapling, some useless ground, and a bunch of mods you might have never played with, and then say ""go study these mods for another 3 hours; we won't tell you which mods to look at, we won't tell you what your goal is, and your only clue is to come from someone else who has already gone through this and figured it out"" are nothing more than distributed time wasting.

Except for the things that we weren't pointed at, like absolutely no hint that there are backpacks in this pack. This is not ""poor me"". This is ""I think this is bad design, and here is why.""

Your OP is offensive given that you paid exactly nothing for SevTech but have the gall to stand up on a soap box and complain about, how a group of hobbyists did not make this pack for the general population.  As you have repeated pointed out, the pack was made for Sevadus.  Since you haven't paid money for the pack,  they are under no obligation to do anything.  Yet your attitude is that of someone that paid money for a product and is expecting a much higher tier of support.   This make you and entitled jerk. I have perused all of your tickets... honestly most of them are just a difference of opinion, and you, in this post come off as your opinion should have more weight than it really does.   The remainder are issues with the behavior of a specific mod which would need to be taken up with the mod author, not the pack author.   Based on some of the responses... you need to learn how to use the search/filter button. This issue tracker is for things not working as the AUTHOR intended, not how you think it should be, nor how you would have done it.

I am the author of the mod that at first orders has annoyed you so much. ""All of these ""in world"" non-GUI blocks essentially restrict you to only those items that you have room for in your hot bar. None of the rest of your inventory space is usable. My hot bar is almost always nearly full in normal play, and even so far in the pack I don't have much space in it."" This is part of the reason we made these blocks. Why should you be entitled to vanilla inventory management in a hugely modded pack? I was asked to make blocks that worked without guis and were more 'primitive' than the vanilla blocks you unlock later. This was the objective to making players appreciate even the most simple of vanilla blocks once more. ""Good or bad, you have basically chosen to document the modpack and its recipes with JEI. And that documentation is lost as soon as you are using the work stump. The mod page for primal tech (work stump mod) claims that it has JEI support. Yet I don't see it in play."" OK this is a technical problem that involves several mods, of which none of us has a viable solution to fixing. The mod for the most part has JEI support for recipes, but the workstumps are a special case that cannot be added due to restraints on game stages, JEI and Primal tech (as well as other mods) with auto-crafters. The complaints about the placing mechanics are just that, complaints - sorry but I like it and it does what it needs to; limits the player from just throwing a load of things in to a gui with shift clicks and magically pulling out an item. I'm sure many of the things you deem 'unplayable' in the pack are more annoyances than game-breaking, so I'll leave it there at the risk of a wall of text (whoops too late). Cheers, Me.

I thought about handling this differently, but I have a weird feeling that it ended like this in all alternative universes. I would also like to say ""sorry"" to the community. In my opinion this issue should have never been opened and the community of open source project should not be used as a jury in a personal dispute between 2 people. My proposal of fixing this is simple. Since I don't have the information to transfer the donated money back (no more PayPal), I would like to donate the same amount in BTC to some other open-source project on behalf of PELock. I thought about x64dbg as they seem to have a good relation with Bartosz and accept crypto. [So here is the communication] I don't think a comment under a commit is a proper way of establishing communication between us about something like this. I don't think making such communication public makes sense as nobody can verify what happened anyway, so what did you try to accomplish? I already calculated it (below) and just wanted to verify the final amount with you. I never said you haven't donated or miscounted the number of donations, so please let's not turn this into something it isn't. I'm not trying to play any card here. I'm trying to make us even in a polite way so we both can move on without a feeling that one owes something to the other. Remember that it was you who started this publicly. So if this stays public then I would like to disclose the amount as i think it's very important considering what you wrote in that issue. So as a result I want to return you what you have invested, because I disagree with your methods and the way you started dealing with it. You have no information about the number of donations that I have received nor their amounts, so please stop these speculations. For your own information - donations are symbolic to me - they are nice and I'm glad when somebody appreciates my work, but it's more about the appreciation than finance to me. I would not be working on asmjit or other open source projects if I wanted to make more money. I love sharing my work and I don't demand anything in return. After all of this I don't want to keep the money and that's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't even insist on sharing any details of the issue publicly if we can just resolve it quickly and quietly without further escalation. For me this is not worth it, it doesn't move the project anywhere, and it distracts me from other work that I wanna do. So please let's do the right thing to finally resolve this so we can move on. [[Reply - PELock]] Hello Petr, Is anything from this list false?  I have donated 3 times without requesting anything in return I have donated one time for the link (2nd donation) Fine, you could remove the link, I agree with that So why do you keep the donations list if I'm not there (just a name)? You don't want the money but you gladly accepted it back then  It just seems you're not very decent and honest person. I have supported many, many reversing and programming projects and this is the first time someone doesn't want to mention the donor just because he has the money now. This is another definition of low level. [[Reply - Petr]] I'm kindly asking you to read again what I have written. I believe the outcome would be different if we started the whole thing differently, but now it's too late to do that, because I just don't like where this went and I don't want to make it worse. I would really appreciate if you send me the IBAN so we can finally resolve this and move on. I'm asking you like third time and you keep only adding more stuff that I'm not interested in. I really don't understand why you make such a drama out of it. We have different opinions and that's it, life goes on, no need to judge others and complicate it. [[Reply - PELock]] Hello Petr, And I don't understand why is it so big problem for you to leave donors names on your page (I'm not asking for the link), does it hurt your feelings or what? Are you ashamed to take donations? If so and you want to be true to yourself you should remove this sections completely, because you don't even know how to handle it properly.

When the TCP connection has dropped, you can't manually  a connection. When the TCP connection has dropped, you can't manually  a channel. When the TCP connection has dropped, you can't unsubscribe existing consumers.  Regarding point 1. Error handling in async code is generally quite complicated (where should the exception go if all your application code is currently idle?).  approaches the issue by allowing you to register an exception handler with the event loop - so in theory all  needs to do is raise an appropriate exception when the connection is lost, and then you can use the loop's exception handler to build any application-specific retry logic. I happen to know that the transport calls  when the socket dies. It looks like our  doesn't override that method. I think all it needs to do is  - I'll accept a pull request (with tests) which addresses that (I may get some time to work on it tomorrow but I can't make any promises). Points 2-4 seem related to me (though I split them up because they may require separate fixes). Thinking out loud - I guess that those three methods try to send a frame over the wire to the server, which blocks forever because the socket is dead. I suppose one option would be to throw an exception when you try to send data through the protocol if the connection has been lost, and do some sort of ""emergency shut-down"" of any live objects or tasks which assume the connection is still open. In general, 's error handling capabilities have room for improvement.

It seems to me that there are two places that should raise this error. The  method as you mentioned, but also inside 2) Things seem to block waiting on responses from the server inside of . It seems reasonable that if a connection is closed, there's no point in awaiting on anything so an exception should be set inside each future in each Syncroniser. The problem is that each connection needs to know about each Syncroniser in use in order to do that. I haven't totally digested how it's broken up, but I think the intial connection will have it's own Syncroniser, then each channel, and again each queue. I'm guessing that we would store a list inside each protocol instance and pass a reference to each channel/queue so that they can register any Syncronisers created with the connection. Then, when the heartbeats time out, or the connection_lost callback is triggered a set_exceptions method is called on each registered sycnroniser for that protocol instance(connection). Then each function that could be awaiting will have to look for the exception and handle it appropriately. I'd be happy to try to put together a pull request with tests, but I want to get your take on how things should be done before I get too far into it.

Regarding point 2, a little extra architectural knowledge off the top of my head might help. Each channel (including the connection, which is defined by AMQP to be channel 0) is essentially an actor with an inbox of frames from the server. The channel autonomously pulls frames out of the inbox and processes them using the correct method in the . The  is basically the entry point for a channel to process a frame. The inbox is implemented as a  - there is one queue per open channel; these are managed by the . So when a frame arrives, the  tells the  to put the frame in the queue of the correct channel. The  is basically an implementation detail of the handler; it keeps track of which objects on a channel are waiting for which frames and notifies them when a frame arrives. It mediates between API classes such as  and the objects which respond to the server (the s). So given all that, I think that error handling should respect the current architecture and go via the  and the . I think the right way to go is to add a special type of message which shuts down the actor (this is usually called a ""poison pill"") and a corresponding method on the  to respond to it. I guess this method would tell its  to kill all of its currently-live . The downside of this approach is that the poison pill message has to wait in the inbox until everything before it in the queue has been processed, which could cause problems if those messages block or if  never gets called - though I don't think that'll be too much of an issue in practice. That sounds like quite a lot of work to me. If you want to submit a pull request for part 1 (raising exceptions from the  when the connection dies) and leave part 2 (the poison pill message) to me then I'm fine with that.

Teaching is a specific activity, separate from ""normal"" github use.  These repositories and accounts should only be visible in github after specifically logging in through/doing a procedure from the ClassRoom interface, i.e. the place we sent the invitations to create private repos in the first place. At the minimum we need a global ""filter all ClassRoom related"" on personal setting of github profile or something, so teachers can also do research. I realize this is an interaction between how ClassRoom uses github to mascarade teaching into a git image. It is still a messy bug in the sense that I would need to open a second github account specifically for teaching at this stage, but I like my account. To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior  Use github for normal github usage  develop open source Enroll into classroom Click on 'Send Assignment Link' to about 100+ students, 3 weeks in a row Add a github filter to your mailbox Connect to github, try to find any of your repositories in the ""repos"" search box.

I'm new to CP and to be honest I think they have done a great job so far, it makes the game more playable and less boring. Ok yes there are some issues with the mod but at the end of the day its a mod and not a game, these people who make mods make them in their own time without getting paid. Its a free addition to the game which imo think its a must have for any serious player it just adds so much more time for you to do other things while the bots take care of all the jobs you hate doing, have a bot plough a field and another harvest another field while you go and tend to the animals. I think the authors deserve a little more respect for taking the time to create such a mod, bare in mind they can only add things or fix bugs when they have time to do it, they might be working at least 10 hours a day for all we know and only have a couple of hours to look at the mod.

You've made it very clear that this issue being fixed is important to you. Open source is tricky, and I understand that relying heavily on a project like Electron can be scary, frustrating, and confusing. We do not want to break anyones apps. None of the maintainers want that. We even run a program to help ensure we fix participating app's major issues during our beta cycle. However, because of the Electron maintainers' limited time and resources, we can't get to everything immediately and some things we can't get to for an extended period. This is common in open source projects. Repeatedly commenting with no new information and ""shouting"" at the development team by using all caps is not something we do here. Moving forward, I would recommend reading and following the advice in Creators, contributors, and collaborators. Just to be clear, you are welcome to continue participating in the following ways  submitting bug reports with enough detail to reproduce - ideally a Fiddle example a new feature request with context logistical questions that may not be covered in the docs (e.g. asking about release timelines in a polite way)  Including additional comments in all caps or responding repeatedly with requests of the maintainer team are off-topic and will result in those issues being closed immediately. Please follow the next step exactly Let's all take a moment to digest the above. Please do not interact with the project for 24-hours. No comments, new issues, or pull-requests. After that, please look through your open issues and edit them to ensure they're entirely on-topic, and we can continue the discussion here about the best way to engage going forward.

In this case, many of us are using some other mechanism to restrict access - or some don't want auth, period. Anyone making these decisions takes the risk balance into their own hands when changing from the responsible default setting. It's sort of like saying Windows shouldn't have an option to disable a password authentication to the machine. But there are use cases that dictate or necessitate the need of such a practice. In my scenario, I'm using nginx to redirect to an auth server/service before anyone gains access to anything on the domain. So DNS rebinding is not an issue in this case, and auth is not a security issue as I've setup a different auth.

It took me almost a full year to discover the problem and today I had some spare time and I tried to find where exactly arduino hangs/freezes. I discovered it is usually when executin getFIFOCount() or getIntStatus(). I discovered that inserting many Serial.print with tags along my entire code so I could know exactly which line hanged. So I discovered everytime my arduino hanged/freezes it was at a line with getFIFOCount() or getIntStatus(). So I decided to take a close look at it. Inside the file MPU6050.cpp there is a code like this uint16_t MPU6050getFIFOCount() {     I2CdevreadBytes(devAddr, MPU6050_RA_FIFO_COUNTH, 2, buffer);     return (((uint16_t)buffer[0]) &lt;&lt; 8) | buffer[1]; } I checked the function ""readBytes()"" inside I2Cdev.cpp and I found this I2CdevreadBytes(uint8_t devAddr, uint8_t regAddr, uint8_t length, uint8_t *data, uint16_t timeout) You see the problem? The function readBytes accepts one last parameter which is ""timeout"" but the function getFIFOCount uses readBytes without the timeout parameter! That's probably a bug cause sometimes I think the readBytes takes too long to execute and a TIMEOUT SHOULD BE set to avoid the function hanging out forever. I am pretty sure maaaany MAAAANY other people alterady experienced this problem and spent a lot of time trying to understand what went wrong. Some people mistakenly believe it's related to bufffer overflow in the FIFO or because of some non optimized code. It could be the problem but MY PROBLEM FOR ALMOST A FULL YEAR has been this bug reported here. I really hope someone fix this and add a timeout so nobody would spent entire months anymore seeking a problem that's is really hard to track an intermitent.

The best laid plans of mice and men, as it were... However, in this case, I strongly doubt that it is the lack of a timeout argument that is causing the underlying issue. Arduino's Wire library does not actually provide timeout functionality. If you dig into the code, you'll see a blocking loop in the TWI calls. See this for example  a timeout in I2Cdevlib code would make zero difference, because there's no way to pass it to the underlying Wire/TWI implementation. The only way around this is to use a different timeout-capable I2C implementation. This is possible, but not simple. I would recommend checking the SDA/SCL lines with a logic analyzer to see when/why the sensor stops responding. The blocking loop inside Arduino's Wire/TWI code should not hang as long as the sensor responds according to the I2C spec. ",1,0.8871458532522698,0.5725340136054421,0,0,-0.8435,n

Yes, I am reasonably certain that the I2Cdev core and especially some of the device libraries are not bug-free. However, they have worked remarkably well with very few changes for literally thousands of people, some of whom have come back to tell me so after the fact (with complete, stable, working project demos). As noted in my comment from June 28, I2Cdev core code itself does not contain any loops that could lock up the whole system. The Wire library, however, does. This is well-documented and tracked separately. It is not something that I2Cdevlib code can fix, other than switching to a different I2C implementation (which is not a bad idea, but it is outside the scope of this bug report). I still contend that I2Cdev core communication works correctly as long as the hardware is electrically reliable. If the hardware is not electrically reliable, the CPU freeze is because of the Wire library, which has a blocking  loop and no timeout as documented in Arduino issue #1476. I have taken the example code that you posted on June 28 and run it with no modifications in the following setup  Arduino IDE v1.6.11 I2Cdevlib repo pulled from latest Github master branch Official Arduino Uno R3 GY521 breakout board for MPU-6050 AD0 pin tied to Arduino GND VCC pin to Arduino 5V (GY-521 has 3.3v regulator on board) SDA/SCL pins connected to Arduino SDA/SCL correctly Saleae Logic analyzer monitoring SDA and SCL   Your sketch compiles and flashes correctly. The DMP initialization completes without issue, and the YPR output settles within a few seconds to a stable value. I have left it running for 15 minutes with no problems. It has remained totally stable with no freezes, FIFO overflows, or other problems. To test, I pulled out the SCL wire to simulate an electrical issue. This (at least this time) caused the SDA line to get stuck low  The I2Cdev core is not doing this inside its own abstraction code. The GY-521 has 2.2k pull-up resistors on the SDA/SCL lines, so something is driving SDA low during a read operation from the Arduino side. Reconnecting the SCL wire does not resume normal operation, even with all zero data coming back. This suggests that the Wire library got stuck in its blocking  loop while the MPU-6050 sensor is holding SDA low waiting for more clock pulses, which won't come because the Wire library is stuck. (Maybe. I haven't dug into the Wire library's guts.) But the main point here is that it worked perfectly until I broke the hardware on purpose. I will reset the Arduino and let it run for another long while just to confirm this (expected) behavior. ",0,0.47050414399946505,0.4383809523809525,0,1,-0.9667,n

No. I appreciate your help, but I think it would be smart to let people know that your library sometimes crashes. Yes, I executed this same code many times with no problem. But sometimes when I just add some lines of code it gets completely unstable, and after a while it does not generate any other problem. Jeff, I dont have bad wiring, this is not my case. The wires are very well connected to arduino.  I realized this bug happens when you call mpu.getFIFOCount() too many times in small time frame. It almost always freezes at mpu.getFIFOCount() (right when it gets executed). I know that for a fact cause I puted serial.println before and after that function, and it freezes the only the first serial.println. You library may work fine in a moment, in another it just does not work. Adding some lines make the code break sometimes, and other times dont (there is no conflict between your code and those new lines). Jeff, I appreciate your attention and efforts into this library but something is not right. Maybe you are right and it's bad wiring, but in my case it surelly is not. I tested this setup in other arduinos and got similar results. I dont know if you ever heard of SEBRAE here in Brazil. It's an education institution ""for free"", with small fees. I know at least 2 good friends which are teachers of this institution in electronics and also confirmed the problem I was facing. It was them who made me come here and report this. I tried to report this problem in many different foruns and in almost all cases, in the middle of the thread, other people confirmed what I said and had the same problem with different setups. If you think this problem happens of because of some lines of I2C getting LOW, why cant you setup and interrupt in your code to check if the line is LOW for too long and maybe reset the device it that timeout happens? I never used an original arduino, I always used clones, maybe some poor build in those clones cause this problem? Sorry if I disrespected you, you are a nice guy who devoted lots of time to this library however I think, IMHO, that it's not safe using your library in quadcopters, robotic arms... someone could get seriously hurt.

The problem is not with his library, but with the Arduino Wire library itself that is part of the Arduino IDE. More specifically it is the two-wire interface (TWI) library that the Wire library calls to handle I2C communications. I stumbled upon this discussion looking for an alternative implementation of an I2C library for a unrelated device I am using and can confirm that any device that calls the Wire library will suffer the same issue you are talking about. While loops are used in the TWI library for communication, and as a result, the code can block all other functions on the Arduino while it is waiting infinitely in the TWI while loop. Jeff demonstrated the infinite loop by pulling out the SCL wire from his hardware. Internally, the TWI library provided by Arduino waits for a response from the sensor that is never coming because the physical wire is removed. While your friends at SEBRAE confirmed the behavior, like you they have wrongly assumed it is due to Jeff's code. If you took a different I2C sensor with a library written by a different person (such as the one for the sensor I am using) and pulled a wire, it would behave the exact same way. As for why can't Jeff put an interrupt in his code to check if the line is LOW for too long, the library is blocking anything from happening (Which is why everything stops). The Arduino environment is not a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The issue is outside Jeff's code. I hope this clarifies the issue. ",0,0.6500995034373047,0.3901785714285714,0,1,-0.7758,n

The issue I am having is actually related to the BME280, a distant relative of the BMP180 sensor, and communications via TCP/IP. My hardware and project is quite different from what you are discussing, and I do not use the MPU6050. From my quick Google search it sounds like the sensor does a lot, and making it work with other I2C hardware is tricky. I wanted to offer some feedback only because I noticed the strong language in your reply to Jeff. I did a quick test with my project, in which the BME280 is the only device communicating via I2C. My microprocessor is an ESP8266 (Which is quite a bit faster than the Uno) and I am using a common industrial protocol over TCP/IP. I have some software that is polling the ESP8266 every second, and I am actively debugging using the serial interface, so there is additional work being done by the system. I pulled one of the wires, and the system kept working. I put the wire back, still no problems. I tried this a couple more times, randomly, and finally the system stopped working. I am only asking for one value via I2C and one value over the industrial communication channel, so I would guess that if I increased the amount of data through the different interfaces, the problem might start to happen more often.

I use Jeff's library together with the NRF24L01 Radio 2.4GHz transceiver library on an Arduino UNO. The idea is to read data from the MPU6050 and then transmit it for further processing by a nearby computer. My problem with that was that I would, like most of you, see the arduino freeze after some seconds. The chances of getting the problem was somehow correlated with the use of the serial print, but not just that in my case! I work on an university robotic lab, thus I have permission to use multiples arduino boards. One day, trying to debug the problem, I noticed that the code would run normally on some arduino board (not freeze) and not in others. I had those made in Italy and those made in China.. It turns out, only the Italian ones work.  If I upload the same code on the Chinese boards it doesn't work! So, I assume, there must be some hardware incompatibilities issues with the library. In summary, I removed all calls to serial print inside the arduino loop function and use only Italian made boards. In the receiver code (arduino connected to the computer), I use the jeff's library with ros, in order to read the transmitted data from the serial port. It works for me!

No, not really. MPU6050 latching SDA low is a violation of I²C protocol. Thus, this means undefined behaviour for the library. It really is up to you -- as system engineer -- to handle such situations. There is no universal way to unlatch such a chip although a common technique is disabling I²C, sending 9 clock cycles over SCL pin (as a GPIO) and reenabling I²C mode if SDA unlatches. (Or resetting the offending chip, if possible.) Regarding, the situation with Wire -- it would certainly be nice if it could detect a SDA latch condition as it currently just freezes preventing further handling. This is in fact an oft requested feature. Of course, this requires use of a Timer which is a precious resource on an Arduino. Either way, in my humble opinion, the only correct way for Wire to go about it -- if it were to implement timeouts -- return an error, and let the designer handle it. @friend may (or may not) then choose to implement quirky chip handling, but currently his hand are tied.

My current setup includes a generic MPU6050 (probably a GY-521) and a Dual h-bridge motor driver board and Arduino Pro mini running at 5volts/16mhz. I am using Jeff's library and it works well without the motors running. I am using DMP to get the values from the Gyro. However problems seemed to come when the motors already turned on. At first I tried to eliminate the problem's cause. My first guess is that it's due to the motor's noise that's causing the MPUs erratic behavior or freeze. When running the MPU with the Motors turned on, the longest I can get is about 15 seconds and it seems I am blocked somewhere in an infinite loop. The motors are still running but I could not make it react using the IR sensors and if I pull off the MPU during the run, the functionality of my motors' feedback system resumes.  So I suspect that it's the motor driver that's causing the erratic behavior of the MPU. But here's the interesting thing, when I used the code from here  using Jeff's library), in fact it's also using the Wire.h. I integrated my motor functionalities into the new sketch to see if both MPU and the motor runs, then I was able to make it work it runs indefinitely without MPU readouts freezing.

The code from arduino.cc example, for instance, does not use the DMP, so the MPU itself is operating mode without making use of its internal processor. Since this issue has focused on failure case when the DMP is active, that's a significant difference. All comments on this issue referring to raw data access only (no DMP) indicate that the I2Cdevlib code is rock solid. Unless the freezing problem also happens when using I2Cdevlib code for only raw accel/gyro readings, @friend's case does not actually add new information to what we have already seen. Also, the I2Cdevlib code adds some (very) small processing overhead to each I2C transaction since it is another layer of function call abstraction around the core TWI hardware. Given the seemingly random nature of the freeze failures, it is possible that unpredictable small timing differences have an effect on whether the failure case occurs. If this is happening, it still does not necessarily mean that I2Cdevlib code has a defect, but only that I2Cdevlib code increases the probability of conditions necessary for the problem to occur. To get back to the fundamental point here  MPU6050 latching SDA low is a violation of I²C protocol, as @friend pointed out. The Wire library has an internal blocking infinite while loop with no timeout/cancel mechanism. I2Cdevlib code has no blocking infinite while loops itself, and cannot break out of the one in the Wire library..  In other words  The MPU6050 is doing something it shouldn't, and The Wire library does not accommodate this behavior cleanly, and I2Cdevlib cannot fix this without requiring a dedicated hardware timer or else rewriting or replacing the Wire library itself, which is technically possible but outside the current scope of the project and would necessarily compatibility with current and previous Arduino installations.  I am all for clean, bug-free code, but I have yet to identify any potential root cause(s) for this behavior in I2Cdevlib. The true root cause appears to be in the MPU itself, or might be worked around (or at least detected) with a Wire library improvement or kludge like testing  inside the while loop. Detecting and mitigating the problem at the I2Cdevlib layer while still using the Wire library as-is would require a prohibitively complex and resource-intensive addition of timers and interrupts. This type of fix would be more suitably (and just as easily) added to the main application logic rather than the I2Cdevlib code, since 99% of the time it would be irrelevant for other I2Cdevlib users.

All your conclusions and assumptions are correct (IMHO) but would you mind explaning why when I grab data from the MPU6050 (raw) it never freezes and when I grab using MPU6050 intermitently is freezes? For example, the code below works PERFECTLY. Never freezes, is super reliable and I never never never had any problem when using it. If there was any problem with MPU6050's processor or some timing issue, it would create some intermitent problem when also using the code above.

The issue seems to concern the MPU's behavior when the DMP is in use. By all accounts, the fact that it works perfectly when you use native Wire API calls to get raw data but it randomly freezes when using I2Cdevlib code to use the DMP is not because you're using I2Cdevlib code in the failing case, but rather because you are using the DMP in the failing case. I fully expect that if you did test the getMotion6 example with your hardware, it would work fine. Likewise, if you mimic the DMP initialization routine yourself using Wire and not I2Cdevlib, and then read DMP packets from the FIFO also using Wire and not I2Cdevlib, I expect your hardware will fail the same as it is doing now. It may be worth rolling my own I2C/TWI implementation with timeout support, or switching the underlying implementation to something like NBWire. However, I'm not sure it is worth spending a lot of time specifically troubleshooting a case that only appears to occur with clone Arduino or especially clone MPU parts. If the problem originates inside the MPU, then there is no guarantee that we could fix it even if we could detect it and avoid a blocking case. That would, at least, allow triggering an MPU reset instead of just freezing the entire CPU though. ",0,0.6209800540205395,0.5823780794369029,0,1,-0.901,n

Maybe it's enabling the DMP that causes the problem in the module. I just dont agree with your argument that this problem ""only"" appears with clones.

Maybe in your country people can afford original ones but here I am pretty sure no more than 10% of people use original/certified hardware.

He also demonstrated how you could unlatch the data pin by forcing clock signal.  This has nothing to do with i2cdevlib and rather is linked to flemsy hardware and TWI driver implementation. I make a living developping embedded software. This is a common issue I had with numerous sensor. The sensor get stuck in is state machine and does not complete the I2C transaction hence keeping the data line low. I have implemented multiple I2C driver for a variety of mcu and now I always implement a recovery sequence in which the mcu take control of the I2C line and bit bang is way out forcing either a stop condition or a software reset on the sensor (see any I2C protocol documentation for this).

However, I think this issue should be closed, or at least have the discussion locked, because it's not going to solve anything. Let me recap the findings  The peripheral (MPU-6050 in this case) is behaving in way that is disallowed by the I2C spec. This is not a bug in the I2Cdevlib code. The underlying I2C/TWI communication layer (Arduino Wire library in this case) contains a blocking  loop that assumes all peripherals will follow the I2C spec. This is not a bug in the I2Cdevlib code. It's not even a bug, exactly, in the Wire library; however, it is a missing feature.  In light of this, there are a finite number of options  Use a sensor that doesn't break the spec. This is not suitable for those who need the MPU-6050 for whatever reason. Patch the Wire library locally with the addition of read timeouts. This is possible, but it requires extra effort for each user. Also, it is strictly outside of the scope of the I2Cdevlib project. Improve the Wire library officially by implementing timeouts and submitting a pull request. This is an ideal solution, but it requires a lot of agreement from many people on the Arduino project. It too is outside of the scope of the I2Cdevlib project. Implement a custom TWI/I2C communication layer with timeout support. This could be done within the I2Cdevlib project, but it would necessarily mean than projects using I2Cdevlib and its custom TWI/I2C layer could no longer use Wire, making it somewhat restrictive. This solution would fairly be considered a new feature, not a bugfix, as it is not actually fixing any bugs in the I2Cdev code. Implement a hardware timer/watchdog to interrupt the while loop if needed. This is theoretically possible as well, but it requires using on-chip resources that are already quite scarce in order to solve a corner-case failure triggered by an outside peripheral device behaving badly. This could be added to your application logic, but I would never want it to be part of mainline I2Cdev code.  All further effort towards solving this should be directed at patching the official Wire library to include cross-platform timeout support, as this would add real value and address the pain points that many people are experiencing.

First off, I'm not accusing you of trickery, I'm highlighting your naiveté in hopes that in the future you put more value on the people you're working with. Second off, there is no company. You have no company. You have an idea, and an idea is worthless without execution and followthrough.

You're not forming a partnership, you're bald-faced trying to fuck them. Take a look at examples of historical and modern startup equity among co-founders.  Jobs convinced Steve Wozniak to take something like 30% ownership in an early Apple. It's widely accepted that Wozniak got capital-f fucked by that. You are not Steve Jobs.

Next, there is no ""owner"" of an idea. It's an idea, unless you patent it, in which case you get about 15 years of protection (good luck patenting any variation on a social network, by the way!).

If the build fails or you don’t have such unconditional trust in your tests, this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.  &lt;details&gt; &lt;summary&gt;Release Notes&lt;/summary&gt; &lt;strong&gt;v15.5.2&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="" (2018-06-11)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Bug Fixes&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;package&lt;/strong&gt; update hook-std to version 1.0.0 (&lt;a href="" new version differs by 1 commits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="" &lt;code&gt;fix(package) update hook-std to version 1.0.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href="" diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/details&gt;&lt;details&gt;   &lt;summary&gt;FAQ and help&lt;/summary&gt;    There is a collection of [frequently asked questions]( If those don’t help, you can always [ask the humans behind Greenkeeper]( Greenkeeper bot palm_tree ",6,0.6742609711838186,0.42602495543672014,0,0,0.969,n

This issue has been open for over a week and unfortunately no one has had a chance to look at it yet. We get close to 100 new issues reported each day, many of which are not real bugs, but simply students having difficulty with the math. Unfortunately this means that even with the assistance of our awesome volunteers, we can't always go through and address each issue individually. Consequently, this issue is being automatically closed. If you're still experiencing a problem, please report it again! We always keep an eye on the ratio of users reporting a problem to users successfully using an exercise, so reporting a problem--even if we can't individually address it--really helps.

The benefits are huge for people who, like me, use RHEL for deployment of line-of-business applications.

It looks like this is related to a change introduced with the improved algorithm in msLayerWhichItems() in maplayer.c. The problem seems to be how lines 385 and 386 are interacting with msDBFGetItems/msShapeFileLayerGetItems in that msShapeFileLayerGetItems is returning MS_FAILURE because msDBFGetItems found no items and thus calls msSetError and returns NULL. The line maplayer.c386 then causes msLayerWhichItems to fail before line 388 can say this is an expected condition. The following are the changes I made to mapshape.c (to return MS_SUCCESS) and to mapxbase.c to not set an error that isn't an error. The change to mapxbase.c may cause issues with tileindexed layers with no attributes in the tileindex shapefile failing without an error message. This depends on what the correct behavior is in another place in msTiledSHPLayerGetItems. I think this is for the tileindex not the actual data shapes, and the tileindex does require at least one attribute. If this is true and the mapxbase.c change is kept, an error probably needs to be set in msTiledSHPLayerGetItems if there are no items. ",1,0.7507590998401679,0.30625,0,0,-0.2187,n

I haven't seen any in my 1.4.2 world, so they might be invisible. Chest Lid or body of chests and enderchests rendered invisible. Signs Sign rendered invisible, text remains. (Possibly only with Optifine, have not yet seen in Vanilla) I have not yet seen any Endermen, Cave Spiders, Blazes, Villagers, or Zombie Pigmen. I do not know if they are effected. (CORRECTION All mobs are effected) UPDATE After updating Java and LWJGL, the bug is not fixed but far more random. The previously effected mobs now have random parts missing. Attached screenshots. The burning effect you see is actually fully-invisible zombies burning in the sun. UPDATE 2 For reasons that I cannot fathom, either carelessness or system error, this has been marked as a duplicate of MC-61 and resolved. This is not the case. I never made any mention of invisibility potions, and this bug still exists as of 1.4.7.

We've asked for help repeatedly over the years, as we've all got jobs that distract us from supporting open source software, despite our best efforts and intentions. I'd like to ask that you pay attention to the tone of your message above. ""Ignoring Windows"" is clearly an untrue statement, given the number of hours I've personally spent, the number of hours @friend has spent, the amount of time we've spent providing automated testing tooling for Nokogiri on Windows, etc., etc. Windows support in Nokogiri is first class. We provide precompiled DLLs for users who want a fast, simple installation; and we provide support for users who want to compile Nokogiri and libxml using DevKit. Saying that we're ignoring Windows users is absurd and a little insulting. Currently I'm blocking a release that supports Ruby 2.5 on windows on getting Ruby 2.5 supported in our test pipelines. I accept some fault for not being more transparent about this as the blocking factor. But now I'm trying to make amends by communicating exactly what's going on behind the scenes to properly support you and the platform that you use. Not ignoring you or blaming you, as you claim. I'm going to lock this issue because I really don't want to do a whole back-and-forth.

Two important parts of python philosophy () are 'Explicit is better than implicit' and 'Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.'. I point these out because a bare except is a special, highly implicit case. Every other  has an 'argument', indicating the scope of the error to be handles.  Even if that's 'everything', it's better to explicitly state that. 'There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.' also applies, since you can accomplish the same thing for the low-low price of 14 characters.  That's simply not enough of a 'savings' to make it worth it. There's also the fact that things like KeyboardInterrupt aren't caught by  for a reason.  Those represent very exceptional cases - cases which shouldn't occur in normal (e.g. production) operation unless something has gone very wrong or the user is explicitly requesting an immediate shutdown. In regards to @friend's use case Why do you want to clean up those temporary files in every possible exception case?   tells me that you don't know what exceptions may be raised.  In those (hopefully rare) cases, your app will certainly crash (unless you have a bare except that silences every possible exception, but that's really bad), and you will need to investigate why.  A temporary file is part of the state of the application at the point in time, and therefore will be forensically valuable. If you know for sure that the temporary file will be forensically worthless, then  or  makes that clear, and indicates that you're fully aware of the implications.  If you're more worried about old temporary files accumulating in some way, consider having your app do cleanup as part of initialization.  That idea comes from the Crash-only software pattern (It's a lot more reasonable than it sounds, I promise).  Basically, it's a lot easier to assume that your app always terminates unexpectedly and code against that than to handle unexpected termination as a special case (i.e. Turning off the power is guaranteed to be an option, but a shut down command may fail or be unavailable). As a last resort, there's always .  If you absolutely must break from best practices, then 8 characters is a very small price to pay. ",0,0.45322221559113796,0.5624797178130511,0,2,0.9521,n

This sounds like you're assuming all development is on continuously running applications on a remote server. Things like pycodestyle and flake8 are ""production"" applications that should handle .

I can imagine a few cases where @friend would want to (and should!) clean up the temporary files. Perhaps those temporary files contain some sensitive information and cleaning them up is the secure thing to do. In reality, neither of us know the details and I think we should be assuming that they know their constraints better than us. Of course having some non-sensitive temporary files lying around can be useful for debugging, but there are certainly valid cases where those shouldn't be left around no matter what exception happens.

It may not do much that you find useful, but it does something. The package's description states that it is a ""Command line to private gist. Example gi.py myFile"". From examining the code, that appears to be exactly what it does. Saying that ""everyone would benefit"" if it was deleted may be an expression of your frustration, but is probably not accurate.

SharePoint Framework (SPFx) uses webpack extensively, and react-popper is causing webpack warnings which in turn lead to component load failures because react-popper has not been properly included in the output. Discussion of this issue is linked to an open issue in the SharePoint Dev Docs repository, and while the original issue was thought to be a fault in upgrading SPFx to use React 16, investigation has indicated an issue specifically with react-popper - see sp-dev-docs issue 1315. CodePen demo This is a build issue specific to use of react-popper in conjunction with other frameworks and cannot be reproduced in CodePen alone. Steps to reproduce the problem  Create a new SharePoint Framework solution as per the standard guidelines a. Install gulp and the yeoman generator for SPFx  b. Create a new SPFx Web Part  , accept all defaults Update the  file to use React 16 and  Add bootstrap, jquery, reactstrap a. Note that recently released reactstrap@friend.0.0 uses react-popper@friend.8.3 Add any reactstrap component to the SPFx solution Build and deploy per standard processes  a.   b.   c.  Deploy per standard SharePoint Processes Attempt to load the Web Part in a SharePoint Modern Experience page.  What is the expected behavior? It is expected that no warnings will be issued by webpack, and that the component will load correctly. What went wrong? Webpack issues the following warnings during the bundle phase Warning - [webpack] 'dist' ./node_modules/react-popper/lib/Popper.js There are multiple modules with names that only differ in casing. This can lead to unexpected behavior when compiling on a filesystem with other case-semantic. Use equal casing.

Original error ***Failed to load entry point from component ""2a846d5b-9989-45cc-b7b8-68d8d4e8c231"" (HelloWorldWebPart).

While the error reported when SPFx attempts to load the Web Part appear initially to be an SPFx issue, investigation has identified that the  property which is the root cause of the load failure is from react-popper, and is related to the webpack warnings issued when generating the full output for the web part. As far as I can see, this is because webpack is assuming the reference in react-popper's  file loading the 'real' popper.js is in fact a reference to the same file. Do you have any suggestions which will allow react-popper to be successfully consumed by webpack? Note that I cannot change away from webpack as this is an integral component of the SharePoint Framework. ",7,0.6686008170716248,0.4044094794094795,0,2,-0.9803,n

You have probably noticed this software is completely free of charge, which not only includes the software itself, but also some support from my side, and the will to implement missing features and help as much as I can. However I work on this on my free time (mostly weekends, vacation periods and a few hours from Monday to Friday), which means there's always going to be missing things and parts that can be improved. It's easy to spot what's not working, what made you waste two hours of your time. What's not that easy is being able to see what's actually working (I have ""wasted"" hundreds of hours on this, but you are welcome). In the future you should learn some manners when dealing with free and open source software maintainers, and remember that they don't work for you.

When the user enters a computing ID the cellEdited event is triggered and it makes a call to the server to lookup the rest of the information if the UserID exists. Pretty standard. If the user entering the data types in the UserID and presses 'Enter' or clicks on the next cell everything works fine. When they press 'Tab' to move to the next cell they get an unhandled exception and the data doesn't update. This is only happening on Chrome. Tabulator Info  Which version of Tabulator are you using? Post a copy of your construct object if possible so we can see how your table is setup  To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior  Create a table with data entry cells (input type) Have one of the cells call out to the server and load the row with data when it gets filled. Enter data that will trigger a row fill Press 'Enter' to confirm everything is working Repeat step 3, then press 'Tab'  and see the error.  Expected behavior I expect the cellEdited callback to work the same regardless of how the user exits the cell. Tab is the most efficient way to make your way across a row of data when entering values.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;combineReducers&lt;/code&gt; 的作用就是把多个 reducer 的函数合并成一个最终的 reducer 函数，然后就可以使用这个函数管理 store，先看个示例：&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""highlight js""&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""code""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;&lt;span class=""comment""&gt;//将 reducer 拆分成两个：&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;&lt;span class=""keyword""&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;如上示例，我们调用 combinedReducers 得到的 store 的结构和 传递给 combinedReducers 的对象的结构一致，接下来我们修改 state：&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""highlight js""&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""code""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;store.dispatch(&#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;阅读代码后不难发现，&lt;code&gt;combinedReducers&lt;/code&gt; 处理 state 可以认为是进行了以下操作：&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class=""highlight js""&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""code""&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;store.dispatch(action);&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;store = &#123;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;  &lt;span class=""attr""&gt;todos&lt;/span&gt;　todoReducer(store[todos], action),&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;  &lt;span class=""attr""&gt;counter&lt;/span&gt; todoReducer(store[counter], action),&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;  ... &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;  others othersReducer(store[others], action)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=""line""&gt;&#125;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;combineReducers&lt;/code&gt; 对传入的 &lt;code&gt;reducer&lt;/code&gt; 约定了一些必须遵守的规则：&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;如果接收到的 &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; 是 &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; ，必须对其初始化。&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;reducer 不允许返回 &lt;code&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt;，否则会抛出异常。&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;如果 reducer 未匹配到传入的 action 则最好返回接收到的原始 store。&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;combineReducers&lt;/code&gt; 操作的 state 必须是普通对象，不能是其他的特殊对象，如 &lt;code&gt;immutable&lt;/code&gt; 对象等。&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;当然不仅仅在使用 &lt;code&gt;combineReducers&lt;/code&gt; 是遵守这些规则，使用自定义的类似的 工具函数的时候最好也要遵守这些习惯。&lt;/p&gt;

Since this begs finally some proper attention, I will describe this issue (feel free to remove the comment later as you obviously are seemingly easily to have your feelings hurt regardless of whether the other person intended so or not...). I'll just clarify a few things I've never asked for help in the channel and treated someone ""poorly"". I responded ironically to ptx0's messages, after he spent the past few hours being dismissive or condescending to other people, obviously in some cases users with a very limited skill around ZFS, but that does not merit acting like an imbecile. None of them were insults or hostile, they simply pointed out that ptx0 was assuming things constantly and then replying with an air of arrogance and usually in a condescending tone, despite himself being far from a beacon of excellence as far as technical skill or coding go. Immediately after he proceeded to ban me from the channel, to which I responded in -social pointing out that his attitude and actions making him look puerile and petty regardless of the nature of the ""offense"" by someone else. This knee-jerk reaction came motivated more by petty personal sentiments (and sharing those with some others who, well, fit that profile) than any actually reasonable reasons. Now, on the project you are routinely accepting patches quite obviously without really doing your due diligence, ensuring proper QA, etc. Case in point, the one we have here. It's painful to see that you waste more time on petty nothings over actually making your code or merged patches look like something with a modicum of technical quality. The control over whether contributors are just copy-pasting from other spots (hint licensing violations get people sued), if the patches actually conflict with major kernel features, or symbol exports, or..... is lacking all over the place. How about instead of making up half-truths about people offending your feelings, or your buddies' feelings, you go and properly benefit from the resources you so adamantly defend (and ask others to work with) How difficult was it to grab the patch I sent you from the link, test it, test it again, sign it off and merge it? You need to go around deleting comments and engaging in conversation with the other troll, but you are too busy to actually merge an out of band patch while you waste time over petty fights? Well, good luck with that. And you are surprised ZoL is not taken seriously anywhere but by the homelab/non-enterprise crowd. If you want to be a primadonna, at least have the cards in your sleeve to back it up you can't justify it right now with the standard you are providing your users. And it runs in ring0, so go figure a better way to fend off all those users popping up on IRC asking about destroyed data because you merged a patch from a pull-request that would not stand a moment in the LKML.

I'm sure you didn't mean to do that, right? then you can see how easily words can be misunderstood. however, more than once have you come and ask for input (maybe not ""help"", exactly) and then were rude to the people who were asking you for more information. criticising how they were attempting to help you. we are volunteers who want to help others. we don't want to deal with difficult people. bans aren't permanent, they can be removed.. sometimes bad things happen in life and we need to respond to them appropriately. people are known to have bad days. coming onto the issue tracker and claiming to withhold your help because of an unrelated incident is not an appropriate response to being banned from an IRC channel. I'd been curious who I'd abused so horribly that day and went back and found this I couldn't find any instances of being condescending or dismissive of any new users, though I did help save someone from redoing hours of work and then warned them about a potential issue. this is a part of a pattern of language from you that we have grown tired of. why do you think it's okay to call others imbeciles? who are you talking about? who is ""they""? I couldn't find this conversation. where did it happen? alright, it may have been a knee-jerk reaction. if you'd messaged me to work it out, things probably would have been Just Fine. interpersonal differences can be worked out, everyone in the project wants the same thing. the ZFS test suite is  very new  and has many deficiencies. testing every possible scenario is, as you must be aware, the impossible task. if you've found problems with the process, raise them specifically as new issues so that they can be addressed. I haven't seen anything until just now, but you don't raise any specific issues or offer any solutions, which seems less than helpful. but a lot of it has simply been spent waiting for a PR to be opened. if you're seeing it happen, why didn't you step up and submit one? is it because of the fact you've pointed out in the past that you consider our contribution process on github to be ""for hipsters"" and something you are essentially too good for? if you have any improvements you see you can make, please do so. otherwise you're just insulting the members of the project, again. any license violations should be raised with the project and fixed. can you cite any specific cases? I don't know what you're talking about. it should be easy to find cases where this is true if it's ""all over the place"". is it too much to ask you to not be rude to people when they give you advice? to not come on here and then insult everyone else's work - people who weren't even involved in your quarrel? for what it's worth, I'm not the one who's responsible for merging patches - there is but one gateway for this project to have patches merged. I can review, test, ask for changes, but that's where it ends. Brian is the one who merges the changes. I have to propose a corollary  to your question. how difficult is it to open a pull request? you mentioned back in early December you were going to open one. I deleted your comment here that only served to insult me and hold your PR hostage. if you don't want to submit the PR, don't - other users can do it when we find the time. it's a cooperative effort. you don't care to be a part of the project in the way we've required, and so your patch doesn't find inclusion. is this surprising to anyone? observation I don't know how long it took you to write your own comment here but it seems like you could have opened a PR in less time. this is another example of your pattern of disrespect. ""You are surprised""? who? not taken seriously? that'd actually be news to... well.. most of us, I imagine. I'm not sure I quite follow. you've seen users reporting data loss with a released build? would that be v0.7.10 that we marked as On Fire shortly after release and that was never included in any distribution? maybe an  related data loss back in 2013 from AIO write path errors? but that was never in a finished release. it might actually be helpful to have a list of data issues that ZFS has had in the past, similar to CVEs.
