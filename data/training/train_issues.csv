And if not, after telling you that I Will do, you come here with hurry and get dissapointed because I tell you the priorities of the mission development????? May I say that I am not your fucking slave or is it incorrect?  @friend actually yes it is, i understand the frustation but lets keep it respectfull and enjoyable for everyone, especially that I think you guys just misunderstood due to language translation. In the meantime @friend you are more than welcome to fork this repo, fix this issue and send us a pull request ;) I invite everyone to take 5minute to read this   What is not subject to translations is your -1 reaction and your closing of the Issue  It's actually a functionality which we have already implemented in the community version of Antistasi. It worked this way There was a parameter ""Allow to start a new campaign"" which was OFF by default. If you wanted to start a new campaign, you'd set it to ON manually and then the menu would ask you if you wanted to make a new start. The reason behind this is to ease the administration of automatic server restarts when there is no administration instantly available. It also helped us a lot at the official server because users would just join the game and the progress would get loaded. I am not sure if the autoload is currently present in the mission.  Honestly, it's unclear who this dude thinks himself to talk to me like that. I could certainly put this rude person in place, but I'm not going to do it. You can do what you think is necessary, but I'm not going to help you any more. And more - you can use Google translator when reading the text, without risking to lose the sense of what is written.

Thanks @friend. Back to the roots, omitting his lack of social skills and education, Alex idea was good and Will be implemented (once I finish the whole AI suite which is by far more important).  Will try to persistent save YES by default and only being able to be changed by server admins, so new starts Will allways depend on an admin. Switch commander yes by default and membership yes by default, but those will get overriden once the load is done.  Can you check @friend solution that was on 1.8 version ? The goal is to actually not need any admin at mission restart, in cohesion with the member server/mission restart, especially in the case of auto restart servers.  its more or less the same I Will add this and some other options with defaults. Life will be easier.  I proposed a similar solution in a forum thread so for each of theese options we could make a parameter in the parameters menu. Each parameter will have three options Force ON, Force OFF, Default. The 3rd one (Default) will cause default behaviour with GUI appearing at mission start. Others will force the corresponding options to one of the two states. So We have total compatibility with people already running the mission and we add possibility for other admins to set it to whatever they want.  These are my notes of the params I Will add, pls do not hesitate to suggest a few more Load last Save def Yes Server membership (Overriden upon Load) def Yes. Switch Comm Def yes. TK Punish Def Yes. Mission Radius Def 4Kmts (4,8,12) Allow PvP def No Allow player markers def Yes AI Skill def Medium (mult 0.5,1,2) No of same √≠tems in Arsenal to unlock def 25 (15,25,50) Civ Traffic Level def Medium (mult 0.5,1,2) So if the server is started by an admin he Will be able to tweak whatever, if not, the default values are applied, and those are suitable for open dedis, no conflict with anything. From there, JiP players Will see the traditional Load window for their personal saves, and nothing else.  Arsenal restrictions for non-members allow/forbid taking non-unlocked weapons. In case people want to have membership without these weapon restrictions.  Non members picking non unlocked weapons can mess the game, as in other topics, so if ppl wants to allow that kind of thing they may just disable the membership requirement. Closing as it's already implemented. ",30,0,193,0.23809523809523808,0.2857142857142857,160,18,y
ARKStatsExtractor/cadon/850,0.11177073000000001,cadon,ARKStatsExtractor,Tek Rex Wild Level is calculated wrong,5970,64,37,0.6666666666666666,0,"Can anyone explain to me why this Tek Rex is importing wrong, all the values are correct, but the wild level should be 360 and not 432.   should also post a screen shot of the ingame inventory also so anyone trying to help has more information to help you  Why, I stated that the values are correct.  seriously? cuz you are asking for help and im telling you something might help and you question it. dont expect anything further from me as you cant seem to bothered you even help yourself without being an ass  Assuming all provided information is correct (I'll take your word for it), you admin spawned this Tek Rex or it was generated some other way other than it being tamed. It's current level, 648, is it's post tamed level, you have a TE of 100%, and the only possible way to have 0 domestic levels with 100% TE is the creature was found in the wild at level 432 based on the (proven) level calculation of 432  (1 + (0.5  1)) =  648. The equation is PreTameLevel  (1 + (0.5  TE)) = PostTameLevel. If the creature has 0 domestic levels, it's current level MUST equal its post tame level. If any of this is incorrect, that will completely change the TE and the extracted pretame level. If you'd like further assistance, please provide the requested information.  Assuming you made 100% false assumptions, this is something that has only just happened. I don't have any issue with any other Dino being tamed and it is only the Tex Rex at this stage that I have noticed it with. The current level is its post tamed level and I do indeed have a 100% tame on it. Like I said all the GREEN parts are 100% correct, I DO NOT HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THE SPINO'S that I have added, I DO NOT HAVE ANY ISSUE WITH THE NORMAL REX'S that I have added. And this was not an issue a few months ago, so why is it an issue now!!! And I DON'T SEE WHY I NEED TO POST A SCREEN SHOT OF THE STATS WHEN THEY ARE 100% CORRECT. Seriously the support from everyone but the author  is becoming a joke in here now.  And instead of arguing about what I haven't show, when I have been suing this program for 3 years and never had issues on my server to this extent, that I am dealing with people who refuse to acknowledge that I have stated the GREEN sections in the image are exactly what is on this Tek Rex. But you know what I should post it just to show how much time has been wasted chasing something that is not even the issue.  Math doesn't lie. 360  (1 + (0.5  1)) = 540. You creature is clearly higher level than that so you're either wrong or you're missing something. I have checked the numbers you provided and the lowest possible level is 432 with 100% TE. I'm not sure what you expect the author to do for you if you refuse to provide adequate information to help troubleshoot the issue.  Like I said this has never been an issue before and like I said my Spino works, my normal Rex works  If the server's max level is 360, a Tek Rex can spawn 20% higher level causing it to be level 432. The program is correct here, your understanding of Ark is incorrect.  the servers wild level is 300 and I am very well aware how that all works. Seriously!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  And because you are not listening and going on some wild tangent rant about what you think Here is a list of Dinos, tamed and show the correct Wild Level   and here is a Tek Stego, which also works   That attitude will get you nowhere with developers who are kindly giving you their time for free.  It appears the Tek Raptor has the same issue  Maybe when I state that the values in the extractor are correct, people should listen!!!  Yep both the Tek Raptor and Tek Rex are the only two Dino's I can find that have this issue.  Look, I told you earlier, your understanding of Ark is wrong. When using the gmsummon command for the Tek creatures, Ark instantly adds 20% to it's original level. The command  generates a level 648 Tek Rex (Identical to yours). The command , however, will spawn a wild level 360. If you  any Tek creature, you'll get the same result. Please, stop being so dense in the future.  ASB cannot know the wild level exactly, it uses a formula with the taming-effectiveness to determine it, and in most cases this is correct, sometimes it can be off by 1 level. The Tek-species are special in the way that they have 20 % more levels than their vanilla counterparts. Once they are spawned and you can see their level, e.g. with the spyglass, this is the true wild level, which should also be the level that ASB will display. If Tek-creatures are spawned with admin-commands, the levels can be off, as VolatilePulse explained. So if you spawn a Tek creature with a level of 300, it will actually spawn with a level of 360. So most certainly the Tek Rex you posted first, actually has a wild level of 432. If it was spawned with an admin-command and not by the game, probably the special handling of the additional 20 % led to the confusion. In conclusion, the wild-level which ASB shows is the level you can see on the wild dino when it walks around. As soon as admin-commands like  are used, their true wild level is higher, and also ASB will show this higher level. I'm sorry that you feel offended by the additional questions. I can assure you it's not that we don't believe your statements, it's just that ARK handles some things in a way that is not obvious and we also don't know. Sometimes ARK has bugs which produces wrong values like the HP of Troodons, sometimes ARK just behaves strange, like with the levels of Tek species. To find out what is going on in ARK and how things can be fixed in ASB, we need as much information as possible, so some questions may seem not related to the initial question. In this case it's probably important how the creatures are spawned in, i.e. if they spawned naturally in the game or were spawned in by admin-commands. So I ask you to have some patience with additional questions, usually it helps to resolve issues faster the more informations are available. ",26,1,196,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,298,23,y

Ant-Media-Server/ant-media/579,0.03621577,ant-media,Ant-Media-Server,[Question] Is there any way to protect stream publish URL?,6616,52,31,0.2,5,"Hi there, I don't know if it's the proper place to ask this kind of questions, let me know if you'd rather have this published somewhere else. I'm currently doing some research on media streaming servers to integrate live streaming into Funkwhale, the project I'm working on. Ant media server looks like a really good pick for my use cases, but I'm not sure how to ensure viewers cannot hijack a stream. When creating a Stream in the interface, you can  Copy the RTMP publish url, like rtmp//localhost/LiveApp/499481361945988697107161,  being the Stream ID Copy the player embbed code, like ,  being the stream ID, the same one as in the publish URL  Since the Stream ID is used for publishing purposes, but also shared with viewers, my understanding is that any viewer can easily guess the publish URL by inspecting the player source and potentially hijack a stream. I may be completely wrong or missing something, but I'd like to double check that with you. Is this normal behaviour? Is there another way to achieve what I need (having a non guessable rmtp publishing link)? I can see that there is another issue linked to authentication ( but my idea was that providing a different, non guessable URL (with a different ID, but binded to the same stream) for viewing / publishing. Let me know if you need additional info, and thank you for the incredible work!  @friend  Yes, your mentioned use case is true, publishing and playing are performed according to the unique stream Id. For solve security concerns, Token Control mechanism is developed for the Enterprise Edition. This solution protects your publishing and playing operations. Please have a look at these wiki and blog pages. If you need further assistance please send an email to contact[at]antmedia.io. Blog    @friend thank you for your answer, which raises some concerns. I understand that people need to earn a living, hence the community/enterprise edition split. However, in most if not all projects, the community edition implement the core features that are absolutely mandatory, while the enterprise edition add extra features that are needed for more advanced use cases or bigger installations. The way I understand it, a basic media streaming server allows  One user to publish a stream Everyone to receive a stream  Item 1 is simply not available in the community edition, since everyone can actually publish on any stream. In some cases, additional security is an extra feature, but that's not true here having an even basic restriction on who can publish on a given stream is part of the core use case. Without that, the software is actually dangerous to use for any real-world stream! Let me take a concrete example showing how bad it could be. Alice has a video game a stream on an Ant Media Server (Community edition), with some young viewers in the audience. Alice's¬†streams are completely safe for any audience. But one day, for fun, someone decides to hijack Alice's stream and broadcast porn instead. They can do that in literally 1 minute, by simply examining the Stream URL in the page source and firing up OBS. Alice looses her audience, reputation, and can even be sued by angry parents. Knowing that publishing is left completely open, I don't understand why anyone would use the Community edition of Ant Media. The attack surface and risks are just too big. I sincerely think publishing should be protected by default in the community edition, and I hope that you'll consider that for the safety of viewers and streamers on your platform.  Thanks for your feedback. They are valuable for us. We will think about it with the team, make some evaluation and let you know.  Hi @friend, any news from the team?  Hi @friend, Sorry for late response ( We discussed with the team and decided to continue token control in Enterprise Edition. But we can support you about dealing with this issue with Community Edition. You can rename produced files (HLS m3u8 or Mp4) using Ant Media Server Muxers  Init methods ( an example, for HLS Muxer go to Init method and edit this line to change output file names  doing that, users can not guess stream publish id by analyzing stream URL. Please let us know if you have any issue or just send an email.  Hi @friend, thank you for reaching back to me I have to say I am a bit surprised by your team answer though. Did you consider the security risks associated with the current state of your software? If all Community Edition deployments and Enterprise Edition streams that do not use the Token Control feature are vulnerable to stream hijacking, I believe you have a responsability to fix that. Your current stance is ""our software is insecure, but you can enable a paid option to make it secure"". And even when paying, the token thing is still optional! That's simply not acceptable, especially since you're not advertising this huge security risk anywhere. We're not talking about enhanced, nice-to-have security here (like with two-factor authentication which could be a paid option only), it's about basic, indispensable security for publishers and viewers! Thank you for the code samples, but there is no point in implementing a workaround to secure your software if you're not planning to secure it yourself in the end. If it's really that simple, to fix, I think your team should take an hour or two to implement this fix and protect all the people using your software.  So basically you have an extremely easy to exploit security vulnerability and decided to only fix this is the paid Enterprise Edition?  @friend thanks for the feedback. I should correct some points because it causes some misunderstandings. First of all Community edition provides more and more features even includes some enterprise features and used by lots of developers in the community. Using unique stream id both for streaming and playing is just about implementation example and you can manage other things on your application level based on this open-source project. I also gave an example about how you can change output name of streaming files that you will give to users. Therefore changing these names, users can not reach your stream (Alice's stream ) URL and you do not have any security threat at this point. To make it clear, One-time token implementation is developed for only limiting audience not for fixing a security issue. To sum up, Ant Media Server Community Edition is totally open source software and you can develop your application based on that, during these phases, you can change the structure, way of operation etc. Sure for them, you can get support, documentation etc every time.

Contentify/Contentify/398,0.06537893,Contentify,Contentify,[Bug] Errors everywhere. Nothing works at all.,4863,47,12,0.5714285714285714,0,"So I installed this for a friend, and already at the installation I noticed that much stuff doesn't work. The current release version has errors with the apache_get_modules function, which is disabled due to security reasons, the script wants access to the php main directory, which a php script NEVER should have access to. And after I gave him all this, I just get that  What the hell.  Ok I found the mistake. Ever heard of case sensitive? Apperently not  Hello Contentify is an open source software without any funding or commercial background (currently at least). Creating and maintaining an entire CMS usually keeps whole companies busy over years, costing up to millions of dollars / euros. Lacking these means you have to try to find smart cutoffs. This is why Contentify has zero tests (automatic tests via PHPUnit etc.) and this is why there is no huge testing phase before a new version of Contentify is released. Sometimes this causes error. You faced one of these, because Contentify is developed on Windows, not on Linux. Windows is case insensitive regarding file names.  Closing this one. Please stick to constructional criticism if you want to get help.  The fact that you say ""Developt on Windows"" shows me that you have no idea. Case Sensivity is something that everyone should follow, and I am sorry that you don't see that. Here your critic First apache_get_modules is a security issue and by default on most webservers disabled Second Your installer ignores the entry at the MySQL data and tries as root anyways, you have to reload the page and try again for it to work, I would guess thats because you first try to connect before reading and saving the mysql data. Third Case sensivity is something that exists since years, and it became a standard under developers to always keep case sensivity in mind. and last but not least If it was developt on windows and does not work on Linux by nature, you should write that in the requirements.  And also thank you for being in the EU and not following the laws. Read it up kiddo DSGVO  Oh also btw WoltLab and WordPress are also Open Source and they have way more features.  Another afront, and again you do not care about the reasons. Ofcourse every developer who creates software that typically runs on a Linux OS has to know about the important differences between the target OS and the development OS. Thus however does not guarantee no typos etc are made. Take a look at your own quote, you quoted me wrong (""Developt""). Nothing else happened @ Contentify. A stupid mistake, yes. But if you do not take the circumstances into account you should be very careful with attacking others. And again, you blame others for not creating a perfect software for free.  No I blame you that since more then 24 hours I have nothing but problems with this. And that just because you didn't wrote a capital C , but instead a lowercase one  But whatever, I will fork it, exchange it and do a pull request. Is that enough Constructive critic for you?  Good. Whetever. I don't care. I am not a user of this, a friend asked me to setup it for him and I said yes and since 24 hours I just have problems. I fixed it now, you know about the Case Sensivity error, I don't care about anything else.  Thank you, for reporting the issues and giving explanations why they are issues. Believe it or not, I understand why you are upset. I work as a professional software developer and I‚Äôd be very upset if a software that I have bought does not work. But that is the point, this is not the case here. The only ‚Äúpayment‚Äù is... if some say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, I guess. Getting negative feedback is okay but it is frustrating as well if it feels like an attack against the persons that spend their free time on creating something without making any money with it.  Sorry for being a bit harsh. It was just that the tone of your second and third post was quite unfriendly. Honestly, Contentify cannot reach the same high quality level as for example WordPress. WP has a huge community and lots of contributors plus a strong commercial background. None of these is true for Contentify. Therefore, it has no ads ad all, nowhere at all (except of some recommendations which do not generate any money). It does not spy on you or restrict you. DSVGO / GDPR...  If this really is something that interests you, let me ensure you, the only thing you have to worry about is the use of Google Analytics on the contentify.org website. That's the only ""evil"" third party software that is in use. And on our side, we do collect very (extremely?) few client data and we do very (rarely / almost none) analysis of the collected data. And ofcourse we do not sell / share any user data (not including Google Analytics).  @friend Do not listen to him this CMS is great and thanks for creating!

Thanks  Hi, you can provide your own item list implementation to any model adapter.  @friend , any documentation for that or how to use in more detail ? Thank you For example we have a AbstractItem with three data  Title, Signal, Capacity ect .... Just need when make changes to adapter to have the ability to automatic sort by  signal for example or anything else. How can we do that ?  Its basically the interface for the implementation that is managing the items list. You could for example add an own add implementation and call own calculated adapter callbacks. There is currently no documentation for it, thats true. Your implementation would look similar to the default one but without the default behavior you don't want to have.  I understand that and really thanks for your explanation. Can you help a little to understand it better if you can... So i have implemented   1)  2) in the SampleItem class there are some variables like   Name, Signal, Width , etc.... How to make some modification to this to be able to make the adapter to sort the items inside it by Signal e.x ? So when new items added, deleted or moved, the adapter to be able to resort they ? It would be really great help if someone provide help for this, because i have writed my self hundred of lines to manually make this but sometime it not working or produce bugs like   There is already an implementation that is sorting the items after adding, moving ect.  And you won't be able to use FastItemAdapter for that, better use the FastAdapter and add the model adapters to it.  I see, so this is how i use it  This is the item class  FastAdapter   fastadapter.add(new SampleItem(""TKIP"",""-45"",""WPA"");` can you help how to modify the class to automatic sort by signal please, sorry my low English, Best regards.  `¬¥  @friend , Without making any modification in the SampleItem class ? Just to call this method ? And how we build  or  because no documentation for that i'm sorry ...  you have to store the reference of the ModelAdapter somewhere ofc to add item to it. No modification of the items is required for that.  An sample for the interceptor is  for example, but in your case the interceptor will return the value without nay changes. The item list impl is the class i posted before  @friend , hahaha i have 3 days working for that and my head now is totally stucked D D , please if you can rewrite my implementation in the comment above that i have writted my class and implementation how i add or delete items D D D , you don't have other choice hahahaha, thanks  This isn't stackoverflow.  @friend , I just make a joke, i know that no need for clarification, i just need when add item, delete or move in real time (not added to array first) to make the adapter automatically sort those damn items , i am really sad with that.

Would still be nice to let others you recommend the app (or github in general) to try it. Maybe even before creating an account on github.  @friend Why are the requests unauthenticated? As much as the app is being used wouldn't authenticated requests be better?  @friend he means requests without login would be unauthenticated (as the authentication is done via the login) and thus rate-limited.  Right but basic authentication using the client id and and client secret would be enough for this.  @friend ForkHub doesn't use OAuth to authenticate, as I don't want to manage a Client ID and a Client Secret and force contributors to register their own app to obtain new ones.  @friend With SideWaffle we just registered it the extension as the app using the Client ID and Client Secret and just allow contributors to use ours.  @friend I'm kind of against OAuth authentication in client applications. It's really hard (we can even argue if at all possible) to keep the Client Secret really secret, and making it public kind of defeats the purpose of OAuth altogether.

It's obviously not a  password ask and I am not asking for support. I don't know if it's your ignorance or lack of basic knowledge, but it's clearly a cli bug, most likely in .  FYI you're definitely breaking rule 3 of the CoC Because of other issues, when a sudo command is run, output is proxied through the CLI, so when the sudo password is requested, you don't get the usual command. There was intentional context () to suggest the CLI was asking for the sudo password. Your issue with installing knex-migrator isn't an issue with ghost, rather an issue with NPM and the way it handles installation (on what I'm presuming is node 8)  Falsely accusing someone being not respectful is a serious defamation.

Google's web player has both of these menus, but doesn't have this issue because it's there's no option to keep the hamburger menu expanded or sidebar open. If I choose to keep the sidebar open, then the other menu should not be visible, but being that it looks like that is part of the google play web page, I don't think that is a feasible option here. I think that you should change this behavior back to mirror exactly as google designed it with only one of these menus visible at a time.   So to be clear, you want me to remove a feature because when you turned it on (it is off by default) you didn't like the UX it gave you.  If you don't like the UX don't use the feature, I put big UI changes like this behind options so that people have the choice to use it or not.  I don't use half the option in this app but I added them so that everyone can use it however they want. TLDR The option stays, some people use it and like it üëç  Having redundant menus display isn't a good UX. Perhaps you missed the point of the feedback.  My feedback is that by implementing that option and when a user enables it they now have two display.  On Google's web app, that isn't an issue because only one is ever displayed.  So if you're going to implement an option such as that, make sure it doesn't introduce a double menu or bad design.  Do you want feedback or not?  based on the tone of your response, it doesn't appear that way.  forgot to mention, I want the menu displayed, so I want that feature on, but not if it's also going to display a redundant menu to the right of it.  I always like feedback, but constructive feedback.  You're issue can effectively be boiled down to ""I enabled this feature and I don't like what it did, I recommend you remove this feature"" which IMO is barely feedback and definitely not constructive.  If you have a proposal to improve that feature in some way to meet your desired UX then raise that instead.  It was constructive. by creating that option, when enabled, it displays two of essentially the same menus, which you haven't acknowledged.  That's not a good UI.  my original post provided constructive feedback to say when that option is enabled, hide the redundant menu to the right of it.  what value does that provide an end user.  please at least acknowledge that i didn't just complain and did provide a recommendation.  Dude not trying to be argumentative because I value this app a lot. But I'm telling you from my perspective, the double display of a menu is not a great experience and it was introduced by that menu option.  I'm not telling you it's urgent or should be prioritized.  It's feedback on a feature that was added.  Can you honestly tell me you think having two of the same menus displayed is necessary or useful? ",6,1,84,0,0.2857142857142857,61,2,y

My HUGE concern now is as it stands that I have to go back and hand-parse EVERY encode log and watch every video to determine if the job was truly a success because, had this one instead been a 98% complete encode, seeing ""success"" in both the GUI and looking at the end of the the log for failure (which I would never usually even do unless the job showed as failed) I would have never caught the failure and simply moved it to my library and then wondered why parts either stuttered or did not play at all or in this case, the movie just stopped prematurely.  And given this example and depending on how long this bug has been in place, I'm sure it has already occurred for me and this is going to become VERY time-consuming to hand-parse logs or re-run my media through other tools to verify source media was readable or not. Parsing this known bad encode log for the word ""errors"" renders exactly twelve lines ending in ""errors""....and all twelve have ZERO before the word errors.  I can't stress enough how big of an issue this is. With all that said, if possible to nail it down, I would be interested in knowing how long this issue has existed so I can have an idea of just how long I have to back-trace my encodes and manually review all logs to ensure I don't have not yet watched bad encodes (that HB returned as good) now sitting in my media folders.  Also, is parsing for ""skipping broken unit"" in bad HB versions the best/only way to truly determine when an otherwise successful returned job was really a failure due to bad source media?  TIA!

...   When an error occurs in the original media stream, that's ""end of file"" as far as handbrake is concerned. Completing the encode at that point, it has a successful result. The question is, why did the decoder stop getting data? The answer is almost always a disk flaw, whether it be a scratch or a fingerprint. Even MakeMKV says it can't read the disk at that point, and aborts. MakeMKV might have recorded more about the nature of the flaw it ITS log, but that's speculation about facts not in evidence. The MakeMKV forum has a topic on common read errors  as far as handbrake is concerned, this was not an error in the encoder, so it will return a zero/success response (if running from the command line) or show a green response in the GUI queue.  There is a reason we tell people not to try rip directly from discs. libbluray isn't designed for handling copy protection. (Structural protections, deliberate errors etc). MakeMKV is and they have a massive amount of experience that allows them to better detect fatal vs non fatal errors and in many cases recovery / workaround problems much better than pretty much most other tools out there. They'll have a ton of code to handle the thousands of scenarios that now come up and change with every new disc released.   Much in the same way we recommend running stream repair tools before dealing with OTA recordings in HandBrake. There are tools specialised just to that file type. As far as HandBrake can tell, there isn't a problem here so it did the correct thing in not failing the encode. The error here isn't fatal and won't always result in a failed encode. I reckon, if we flagged every decoder error we see, we'd see a 60+% failure rate on encodes across millions of users.  That's never going to end well for anyone, especially when a large percentage of those won't actually have resulted in failed encodes.  So, our options are actually very limited. Unfortunately, looking at the logs is not sufficient to tell if you have good encodes. No matter what software you use, the only way to be sure is to watch the entire file and pay very close attention to it.  Same with MakeMKV. We've seen it be successful but data that it read was incorrect without error due to marks on discs or whatever.  I've been a developer for 30 yrs (not open source where nobody can fire me) and all I can say is WOW.  I'll be sure to spread the word I had no idea HB's stance was who cares if source media can be properly read and if we can't catch ALL general failures, literally why would we test for ANY of them - even the most basic PROGRAM INPUT testing.  This is basic friggin I/O, not rocket science and you coded enough to log the issue, someone made a very irresponsible call to not call a total FAILURE TO READ SOURCE only 30 seconds in a success.  I hear Twilight Zone music.  For a developer with 30 years experience, your clearly not showing it as it's a hell of a lot more complicated than ""basic IO"".  Handbrake is not a disk ripper. You are having a problem with ripping a disk. You are attempting to use the wrong tool for the job. There are many examples of this sort of problem in the developer world, that even a ""newbie"" like you have encountered. (yes, I've been programming for over a decade longer than you) A disk ripper (like MakeMKV) would tell you directly that the file isn't readable. It would stop the rip with a failure, if you were using its direct interface. Whatever you're using right now to remove the encryption from the BD is likely logging that there is a problem with the disk. But it only tells handbrake ""end of data"". The program handbrake has no way to differentiate between ""end of data because disk is scratched"" and ""end of data because you reached the end of the file"". What handbrake was asked to do completed properly. What you are feeding handbrake with is where the problem lies. How are the handbrake developers responsible for a program that isn't theirs?  And FYI, this has ZERO to do with the PHYSICAL media it is hilarious that was the first defensive knee-jerk reaction to make this go away and close it.  HB doesn't even make low-level I/O calls the failure is in the reading of the actual source file regardless of where the heck it sits.  Copy a corrupt source file, any source file to the hard drive and Handbrake simply is coded so poorly that corrupt source file that fails to read, will not properly fail the job - period.  I just tried it by hex-editing a source file to corrupt it and HB did the exact same thing.  It is fully reproducible and to simply close this issue is absolutely unbelievable.  I understand you're frustrated. Regardless of the issue, you're being an ass. HandBrake is open source, free software, and nobody owes you anything, despite our efforts to provide support in our free time. I'm going to leave these here and lock the issue. Please consider them and if you don't feel like changing your attitude, please go away. ",23,1,2805,0.2222222222222222,0.15555555555555556,991,4,y
HandBrake/HandBrake/1584,0.099647562,HandBrake,HandBrake,Workflow-optimized UI,15537,165,91,0.8,0,"I just finished an overhaul to the VidCoder main UI and I thought it turned out nicely. I'd like to propose bringing it to the official HandBrake UI. I think of the encoding process in three main phases 1) How. How should the file be encoded? What container do we want? What size display are we targeting? How many channels of audio do we need? Does it support anamorphic? What audio and video decoders are supported on the playback device? A user might just pick a preset, or they might go in and set it up manually. Typically you can set this up once and re use it, maybe with minor tweaks across many sources. 2) What. What sources are we encoding? Did we load the right source? Which angle do we pick, what audio and subtitle streams do we include? Do we want only audio or do we want subtitles? What are the chapters named? 3) When. When will we be done? What items are in the queue? How is the encode going? A user will go through steps 2 and 3 many times when encoding multiple files. This is the standard core workflow for transcoding video. The core workflow is here in the current HandBrake UI  Picking what you want to encode involves a journey between 3 different tabs. All of the data is mixed in with the complex ""how"" of encoding that is not relevant to the core workflow. To check what you've already queued up or to monitor the encode, you need to explicitly open a separate window. To streamline this, I put the core workflow into the main window. This allows more real estate to be devoted to helping you get through the common, routine processing steps  Load the source, then you get everything at a glance, immediately editable. If there's not enough room, the sections collapse, showing as much as possible without scrolling. Queue up items and start the encode and the progress/queue is immediately visible. Decoupling the source data and the encoding settings gives you another advantage you can edit the encoding settings without needing a source open. The source area can have an ""open"" UI on it, rather than a bunch of grayed out boxes  I do remember a few objections to this kind of approach when I first suggested it in 2010 But what if I like to tweak encoding settings for every source? That's still possible. The encoding settings window opens beside the main window and stays open on relaunching. It's not modal so it doesn't put up any roadblocks to immediate tweaking. But it doesn't make sense to edit encoding settings without a source loaded. I have not heard of any practical problems or user confusion in 8 years. The approach seems to be working well. But if people batch process, some of the files might come out wrong and people will be angry. This has never happened. People really like the batch processing. There have also been a lot of changes since the initial prototype UI. I've also heard the sentiment that HandBrake and VidCoder are two separate projects meant for different purposes. I don't think that's true at all; I believe firmly that the same software can serve all the use cases of anyone who might like either. It's just a matter of getting there. VidCoder is missing some functionality from HandBrake and has its share of issues and incompatibilities, but I don't think it's anything we can't work out. Let me know what you think. I'd be happy to help with any changes.  We've had this discussion before so I don't feel the need to rehash it again. We don't plan to take the UI in this direction.  We discussed it a long time ago  When the prototype UI looked very different When the proposed UI did not have the at-a-glance accordion source view Before testing with tens of thousands of users over years revealed that Batch processing does not create user problems Editing without a source loaded does not cause user confusion   When people thought I was just some crank out of left field with a bad idea who wouldn't stick around  I think a lot has changed and it's worth another look. Given all this, why are you so adamant that the current UI is the best and only way to do things?  Wait... what changed? ü§£ Seriously though, I don't think this is an issue of ""best"". There are often multiple ways to approach things, and yours may be fine for your user base. It simply isn't a direction we want to take the HandBrake UI. The main comments I would like to make pertain to your premise and the core workflow. The how/what/when idiom again may make sense for you and your users. This is vastly different from how we approach the HandBrake UI. Our core workflow has evolved over the years, and while I'm not one to take a ton of credit, I have been investing quite a bit of thought and design into improving stress areas over time while accommodating new objectives and the features that support them. We've approached things from a realignment perspective (iterative improvements), rather than a complete redesign, and there are more improvements in the pipeline that wouldn't be easily accommodated by your design. Consider for example the proposed dimensions overhaul and plethora of color space/depth related updates we will need to implement before long. Video filters are also more popular than people realize, and more are planned along with better presentation thereof as I/we have time. The current core workflow is probably best explained by the Quick start article. In short, open a source, select a preset, hit start. That mostly leaves ""where did it go?"" and we've improved the destination controls and documentation to help with that, too. The result is that normal humans are more able to successfully use HandBrake now than ever before. I talk to regular people using HandBrake all the time (both in passing and for research purposes) and their experiences support this. So does my stopwatch. The rest of the UI is then what the presets system sets on behalf of the user. While these tabs/controls could be hidden completely (ala Instant HandBrake of years past), they provide no obstacle these days. We've disabled most unnecessary controls on startup and presented the summary tab as an excellent at-a-glance description of what will happen. The team has worked to achieve a hybrid beginner/pro UI design that only reveals more as you desire to go deeper, and I'm very proud of that. So we've solved very specific sticking points for millions of people with the current iteration. I and others continue to do research and design to iteratively improve the existing flow. Your design addresses a completely different set of concerns, so in some ways, we're comparing apples to oranges. While some comparisons can be made, there is no ""best"". The HandBrake UI is on a proven, successful path, and yours is a departure from that path. I don't believe it addresses many of the issues we had, currently have, and plan to improve. If it works for VidCoder, great! I have no doubt this is a useful paradigm for some people. That HandBrake is going a different direction hopefully will not discourage you from continuing to iterate and improve for your audience.  I'm not saying your UI is bad, or that you haven't been improving it, or that people can't get things done or figure out what to do. I'm just saying I think it can be changed so people need to click fewer times and look fewer places to get things done. What makes you certain that any additional changes are necessarily bad? Please try to look at it objectively and not as an attack on anybody or any work that's been done. As for the dimensions overhaul, I've already done it. And anyway that particular UI is not something that's hard to do with the proposed UI. It's just contained in the encoding settings window.  Which, by the way 1) Opens not as a dialog but as a helper window. So it does not force the user to close it to interact with anything else in the UI. 2) Is brought into view any time the user is working with any window in the app. 3) Opens beside the main window if the user has space. 4) Remembers its open state and position. So all that that sizing and filters UI is just as readily accessible as before. Why do you think the sizing or filters changes are not possible with this proposal? I'm just asking you to seriously consider an alternate. How it it solving ""different"" concerns? What concern do you think I am addressing, exactly, and why is that concern invalid? Where did this deep conviction come from that there are two fundamentally different user bases, and that the same UI can't possibly serve both of them?  I took care with my comments took your proposal quite seriously. I'm not sure how I can be more clear that changes aren't ""necessarily bad"", only that we seem to be making different assumptions about what the core workflow is and should be. I hadn't seen the associated screen shot until you just posted it, so please pardon any confusion over dimensions and such. Anyway, I'm not really interested in answering your additional questions. I tried to be thoughtful and I don't really appreciate how you've characterized my comments.  Maybe you and I have different definitions of ""seriously."" By taking it seriously, I meant engaging in specifics, asking clarifying questions and showing an interest in understanding the proposal fully. You instead presented a series of arguments as to why you don't need to think about the specifics of the proposal. That HandBrake is on a ""proven successful"" path. That you've done a lot of improvements. That you want to do more improvements. That normal humans successfully use it. All of which is great, but none of which has any bearing on the merit of the proposal. There are many successful major UI redesigns where before everything was doable and nobody had any complaints, but things still got better after it was reworked. The Windows 7 taskbar, Office ribbon, Blackberry/windows mobile phones -&gt; iOS/Android. Before the changes these all had perfectly usable interfaces with lots of incremental improvements and no specific issue that required the change. Anyway your ""core workflow"" that you claim drives the difference in the HandBrake UI is really not that different. The proposed UI makes that workflow efficient as well, because it's just a subset of the one I described. The final thing that gives me the feeling that you are not taking it seriously was the fact that you marked it as ""rejected"" before any discussion took place and before you even understood the proposal fully. You thought that needing to add filters was going to be a real problem for it. It almost seems like you didn't even bother running VidCoder to get a sense of how it could be working or how it feels to use. Or if there were really any concrete downsides to it! But yes, as you said, you are of course free to ignore any questions or suggestions I have. I figured you probably would, rather than bother to engage, ask clarifying questions and collaborate to reach a common goal. But I had to try.  You should have engaged with us earlier with your ideas and discussed them one at a time before implementing everything if you expected our buy-in. If you were afraid we would say ""no"", that's a pretty good indication it needs to be discussed. We could have discussed this in easier bite sized chunks and we could have spent the time to fully discuss why your starting assumptions are incompatible with our plans for the future and perhaps influenced your design to fit to those plans. Just as a guiding principal, a complete instantaneous replacement of the HandBrake GUI is out of the question.  Gradual migration, testing each idea and getting user feedback as we go, has been our mode of development for a very long time.  This is how we plan to continue development. If you have specific ideas with limited impact, feel free to propose them.  But don't expect us to wade through a large collection of ideas in a massive redesign to pick bits that can be migrated in as part of our continual improvement to HandBrake.  To be frank, I just don't have the time for it.  I'm very busy with non-HandBrake real life things.  I've had no time in the last couple weeks and it's looking like I'll have no time in the next couple weeks.  So if you want feedback from me, you've got to keep it down to something I can read and respond to in a few minutes. Also keep in mind that any new design has to be propagated to all 3 GUIs.  Some designs do not fit well with the UI paradigms of the other platforms.  Compromises must be made for the sake of consistency sometimes.  Bradley and Scott have both spent a lot of time prototyping designs and sharing them with the group before implementation so that we can discuss the impacts of the design. This helps in keeping us all in sync with a design that works on all platforms.  I'm not asking for an instantaneous replacement of the HandBrake GUI. I don't expect you to get on board with everything all at once. I tried to scope this suggestion to one idea Move the encoding settings to their own helper window and show source data with pickable tracks on the main one. It really can't be broken down any further than that. The rest of the post is explaining the reasoning behind it and the downstream benefits I see from it. I do realize that you want all 3 GUIs to have the same design. I would love to hear from them if there are any difficulties in making the change. If it helps, you can look at VidCoder as the ""prototype"". Play around with it and see if the idea could work in HandBrake. I don't expect buy-in without discussion. I would like to hear why you think this idea is incompatible with your future plans. In any event, I'm not complaining to you about having to spend all this work on changes you're not implementing. I'm not sorry I went and built my own UI because hundreds of thousands of people have used it, people have thanked me for it on a regular basis, and I'm darn proud of it. I'm here asking for a discussion because I realized we really do have the same goals and working together we could make something much better. And because what's in the past doesn't really matter, just how we can make the software better in the future.  @friend We didn't ""go through it"" this time. You just closed it without even reading. If you had, you would have realized that every single one of the usability concerns brought up originally ended up never materializing. I haven't had a single user complain and ask to bring the settings back into the main window. At least now I know with certainty that making my own UI was the right thing to do. It's infuriating dealing with people who tell you ""that's bad UI"" without a single valid reason to back it up. And who, when politely challenged simply reject, ignore and lock rather than discuss in good faith.  How many times would you like to go through this and similar suggestions, accuse others of not taking your ideas seriously despite hours of consideration over days in public and private, and meet our constructive responses with argumentative and harassing behavior? We've presented nothing but kindness in good faith. I encourage you to read our Code of Conduct. Nothing we've read from you in our recent interactions respectful of opposing viewpoints, gracious in light of constructive criticism, empathetic, or fostering community. In short, it is clear our views differ; that does not give you a right to behave badly. Harassment in public or private will not be tolerated. This topic is now closed and locked, same as #1657.

NanoCore/NanoAdblocker/87,0.14659896,NanoAdblocker,NanoCore,Disable specific filter on single site,6137,66,18,0.6363636363636364,1,"i think this is the best enhancement  I don't see a reasonable implementation of this...  Filter lists can limit the amount of domains each rule apply to with many ways. If you need to set a different set of filter lists for each domain, then chances are the filter lists you are using are kind of broken.  And there isn't a reasonable way to swap filter lists sets internally.  it depends on how the internal data structure of the core looks like if the rules still have a reference to the list they came from then it shouldnt be too hard to just ignore them on a specific website just like you can switch off blocking completely for a site. if the internal structure is just a huge merged and optimized set of rules, which i assume is the case, then you would have to rebuild that internal structure once you click on that button or when you later load that site again or if you leave and all filterlists should be on again. if the performance hit is too great then there are two ways to deal with it. generate an internal structure for each new combination of active lists and keep it for later or use the normal datastructure when all lists are on and if one or more are disabled then execute each least sequentially. this could behave differently than a combined list, like you mentioned, so maybe some sort of hybrid would be needed. so, yeah, not an easy task if my assumptions about the project are correct. but it would still be a very worthwhile feature that you shouldn't give up that easily. maybe gorhills rework of the engine makes this easier to implement.  Whitelist just completely disables filtering, that's different than disable one specific filter list for that domain. Currently, if I understood the code right, each filter list will be compiled separately and stored, all selected filters are merged together. The merging process need to be done every time a filter list is turned on or off. There are also snapshots of internal states for fast startup. I can't think of a single use case. Did you spelled ""harder"" wrong?  i dont think he wanted whitelisting. if you have experimental or generic filterlists that work well most of the time but occasionally break sites then you want to quickly disable the list for this specific website but not in general and you do not want to go through the dashboard every single time you visit that site again. you should also contact the maintainer but it will take time until it is fixed. you could even just move along and after a few weeks you look up your dynamic rules and post a bug report with all the problems you collected over time but were too lazy to report at that moment. well, unlikely but at least possible  Just override the rule with your custom filters, that's what it's for.  while still a lot more work than 2 clicks i could do this. most people wont. blocking something with the element hider is something many would be capable but figuring out an exception rule is too much for casual users who just set it up, tweak a few options and select and install a few lists and then call it a day. not everyone is going to read the wiki about the filter syntax and then debug every page that causes problems. giving them a better option than having to switch off Nano Blocker entirely or uninstalling a list just because of one or two false positives would really add some usability benefit.  If you are a casual user, chances are you won't be adding filter lists other than those that come with Nano Adblocker.  If you are a casual user, chances are you won't be able to know which filter list you have is causing the problem.  If you can find out which filter list is causing the problem you will be able to set up the exception filter. If you absolutely need to toggle between two sets of filters, use browser profile. This is non-trivial and only has theoretical use case, I'll decline this feature for now.  What I will do is to add a button in Logger that turns off a rule.  mayby quick access to off specific rule on single site example.   If you find yourself have to toggle a filter list frequently, then you probably need to figure out what exactly is wrong.  you do not only want this when something is wrong. maybe you have a list that implements a night mode and you personally do not want it on a specific site or a floating header that you want for some special use case or you want to allow ads for a site but not tracking and annoyances.... besides that it is great for trouble shooting. you turn off lists as long as the site works again. then you immediately know who to send a bug report to.  If you need a night mode or any other mode, use browser profile.  For trouble shooting, use the Logger.  make a browser profile for every website? thats not practical. you do not need that many tries if you always the disable half of the remaining ones. ~log2(n) turns.  an ordinary user will not be able to and will not want to look into the logger.  like this?   You do realize there are over 100 000 rules enabled by default right?  on single site?  O  There are well over 10 000 rules affecting every single site. A lot of generic rules in EasyList.  hmm.. you can segregate this rules to category and hide  gorhill has his decisions, I have mine. If you disagree with both, then you have to look for another fork, or fork yourself, then you don't need to convince me to implement the feature. Maybe we have a different definition of ""casual user"", but I don't think any of the proposed feature is useful. If you need a per-site profile, then chances are you are not a casual user, and should use a custom filter list for that.  Listing active rules on the popup will definitely not be easier to use than the Logger, and casual users cannot understand what they are seeing. If Logger is too complex for them, putting a smaller Logger in the popup will just be worse. I'm not sure what that means, you are welcomed to teach me how to code, but do so in Pull Requests.  I'm locking this as it's not getting anywhere, if you truly believe this feature is necessary, please Pull Request, I can test out the result and maybe I will change my mind.

Osmand/osmandapp/3663,0.03687213,osmandapp,Osmand,Ambiguous/uneccessary driving instructions,11128,139,67,0.5454545454545454,5,"There are a couple of areas where I think it would be nice to have some polish on the driving instructions issued, and when. As a navigator I was always taught 'don't issue an instruction unless it's to change road', and as a driver I completely understand that.  Especially on a motorway, being told every mile or two 'keep right' gets very old very quickly.  I'd rather be told the distance to the point at which I would leave the road I am currently on, and instructions issued for that point only. Also, it seems arbitrary when the 'keep right/left' instruction is actually called - not sure if that's an OSMand issue or something to with the nodes in the OSM data itself. Any chance we can have this as an option? Also, the instruction 'turn slightly right' can be very ambiguous at junctions.  In line with what I mentioned above, I think for clarity having the option to just say 'turn left' or 'turn right' to indicate leaving the current road and moving on to a new road, irrespective of the severity of the turn, would reduce any confusion.  That way the driving instructions aren't overly verbose - they are clear and concise.  Of course I understand that other people might be used to having such verbosity from other driving aids, which is why I'm suggesting making them optional.  May I add a point here sometimes I heard the instruction ""prepare yourself to enter the roundabout in 1 km"" (approximative translation). I don't understand to goal of this one, I think it's useless. What do you think?  It's no different really to 'After about 1km, turn left'.  And some roundabouts can be quite complex, so being aware to concentrate on upcoming roadsigns about the roundabout is a good thing, in my view anyway.  To me, that 'upcoming change of road' is part of the instruction for that road change I was talking about. But obviously that's just me. -)  Disagree with @friend. Imagine you have to drive 225 km to your motorway exit, it is extremely useful to get an announcement that your exit is coming soon now. No it is quite useful. If I get 'turn right' I expect to have to break to slow speed to make a 90 degree turn. If I get 'turn slightly right' the road is forking off at a nice angle and I can do that slight turn at higher speed. And the opposite for 'sharp right'. So the 'severity of the turn' is quite relevant for my driving. This is not what OsmAnd does, to my experience.  See ""Take the right hand road"" then.  Unless you want OSMand to give pace notes (which, to be honest, I would be -very- for ;-) ) Perhaps not on the roads you are on.  But on the roads I drive, there are motorway exits every couple of miles. And, if you'll note, I did stress that I suggested it be an -option-.  All your arguments are for what -you- want, which is also what I'm suggesting, so thanks for backing me up -D  So we need to define complex for OsmAnd, because I often hear this instruction for simple rondabouts (like this one  not the distance which I don't understand, it's more the instruction. Do you see what I mean?  @friend When I read your comment about ""Prepare yourself ..."" and so on, this sounds in deed very clumsy and obsolete. Looks like there is simply a translation issue here with whatever language you are using In English our prompt is simply ""After about 1 km enter a roundabout."", which is short an unobtrusive. If you let me know an equally short translation for your language I can easily fix this prompt (independent of anything bigger we may or may not do about trying to discriminate between larger and smaller roundabouts). @friend I never hear keep left or keep right when passing any motorway exits I am not supposed to take, can you please specify specific locations so we can reproduce? Regarding ""slight turns"" While it is not very easy to always determine the turn angle as it appears to a driver in the real world, it is in deed conventional in all navigation systems I have tested to try and prompt slight and sharp turns. This is useful in cases of forks (where there is really less of an actual ""turn"" to be made), or e.g. in case of 3-way forks to indicate which of these to take. I cannot see that dropping our attempt to announce slight or sharp turns would actually be a general improvement.  @friend Ok, thanks, implemented! It is in our nightly, and will be in the next release. I believe this to be a leftover from years ago, there was a point when we had lots of ""Prepare for ..."" all over in our voice prompts, and it is usually a rather unconventional and useless phrase. I have removed in many languages a long time ago, but for some I rely on translators, and it looks like no-one ever cared for this one. If you find any more improvements worth implementing in fr-tts, please let me know, or better create a pull request, ok? Thanks, Hardy  Cool, that was quick! I'll try it in the next beta release. Thanks for the information about the tts, until now I was only fixing translations via Weblate. About the legacy values in the tts, I noticed that some strings are not in the  (like ) but present in the . A first step in cleaning that even better, would be to sync the source values. What do you think?  Yes, much appreciated. In English, there is no  string because it is not needed there, I create the contract between the pre-announcement and the closer warning by using ""After..."" vs. ""In..."". But in the French config file,the string is in use in command , which is Button 6.1 in my ""Test voice prompts"" system under the Development settings. Please take a look, we would have to redesign that prompt. Please compare in contrast to prompt 6.2 (which would be played closer to the turn). For comparison, try these 2 buttons usingEnglish (select en-tts upon entering the test screen). Please note  You could test any tts-config file on your device as follows download the original  ttsconfig.p from our branch, and modify locally at will. Then, rename it to _ttsconfig.p, and create a folder like fr_test-tts next to the other voice folders (like Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files/voice/fr_test-tts or similar) in your osmand data folder on your device. If you put your modified _ttsconfig.p file in that new folder, you can select it in OsmAnd to be used.  @friend  can't recall exactly which junctions, (it may actually be the M8, not the M9) but it certainly does it.  In fact, it does it so often that I can't recall specifics, I just thought it was 'a thing'. Also, with this junction  the instruction issued was ""keep right"" which is totally unecessary, and in fact confusing given it's a crossroads (which is why I recall it specifically).  There have been a couple of occasions where 'keep right' has been read out where it actually meant 'take the right hand exit' at a fork (which is why I wasn't sure if it was just bad data from OSM or not). Again, for the exits, it's happened so often that the sharp/slight turns aren't mentioned at all when they might have been necessary, and mentioned where there was no need, and in a couple of instances just completely wrong, that I've just bundled it up as 'something wrong with the OSM data/something silly that OSMand does' that I don't even think about specifics any more, it just frustrates me every time.  My brain translates it as 'check what the map shows because that will give you more information than the audio' which defeats the purpose a little.  @friend FYI I just heard the instruction ""prepare yourself to enter the roundabout in 1 km"". Shouldn't suppose to be fixed with your change? (OsmAnd+ 2.6.5)  @friend Looks like this change in fr-tts is in our master branch but did not make it into our 2.6 branch. An oversight? Should I have it marked somehow? Thx - Hardy  @friend  it will be no 2.6 release anymore, 2.7 suppose to happen next month.  The unnecessary 'keep right' instructions are still being issued along the M8  from my observation ""unnecessary"" keep right or keep left announcement are based on osm data. this usually happens if two ways run parallel for short time or has a quite small angle between them. you can often see this at exit lanes where different mapping styles exist. Some Communities map Exit lanes as own way, some other start a new qay only at the Point where the road really splits. In some cases those announcements are very useful in some other they are wrong. For example at this place, going from north to south  there is always a ""Keep left"" but i don't know why.  Yes, that holds with what I've experienced, but only sometimes.  Sometimes the exit sliproad is completely ignored, despite being as just as shallow an angle as other that are indicated.  So does this mean it's OsmAnd's interpretation of the OSM data, or is it a flag set in the OSM data somewhere?  If it's the former, then it's still a bug that's present.  If it's the latter, then it means editing the OSM data.  Best would be if an osmand developer would tell what exact conditions needs to be met to play the anouncement. Do you have some examples where the issue occurs and where not? Maybe ist possible to find something.  @friend I posted a route already.  Some junctions it will do it, others it will not.  @friend It has been a long time since I looked at that code, and I think it has been stable ever since From what I remember, this is about how we do it We look at the angular change a turn after a fork eventually takes you through vs. your initial bearing. If it is between 10 and 45 degrees, a ""Keep Left"" respectively """"Keep Right"" turn type is detected. So I assume that ""false"" announcements may happen where a road forks, and both forks are a slight turn. While driving on one of them, you may perceive this as 'going straight', but looking at an aerial view, you may realize you take one of 2 slightly bent forks legs. I do think we factor in the hierarchy of roads, so this will probably not occur if you are and stay on a primary road, and an unused trail forks in one of its turns. But I am not sure if it may happen in certain forks between a motorway and a motorway link.  And it may be justified there, e.g. some motorway intersections / cloverleaves may be tagged with a mixture of motorway on motorway links on forks which look of rather equal hierarchy when driving on them (vs. in the exit situation you may argue that staying on the motorway requires no turn prompt.).  @friend sounds correct to me, i remember a different place where a fork is within a (slight) curve and the anouncement is played. I think adding an additional condition which checks the road class would fix a lot of those false announcements. But what to do if the road Segments have the same class?  IMHO,  it is often a case-by-case decision and sometimes hard to get 'right' by just looking at the map data. What we do is err on the safe side snd rather play the prompt too often than too seldom. I believe it works well in many areas, but I can well imagine there are issues in rather montaineous areas or other regions with curvy highway sections and associated crossings. Not currently sure how to implement an overall improvement, although most certainly not impossible. ",49,12,413,0.18181818181818182,0.2727272727272727,225,14,n

Sabaki/SabakiHQ/341,0.0870263215,SabakiHQ,Sabaki,Different rule sets?,11564,172,97,0,1,"Is it just me, or does Sabaki not allow making games with different rule sets, e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Tromp Taylor, etc.? It even doesn't show which rule set is being used in a loaded SGF file (under Game Info). I think the scoring is restricted to Japanese only. If I'm correct, then please consider this an enhancement request to allow for at least Chinese and Japanese rules, and perhaps even Tromp Taylor rules, as this would be very useful for looking at games created by Leela Zero. Even if you don't fully implement different rule sets in game play, at least please display the rule set defined in the game's SGF file.  There's no concept of a ruleset in SGF, because the user can do anything they want. Sabaki only show warnings for simple Ko and suicide which can be disabled in Preferences. As for scoring, there is an option to toggle between area and territory scoring.  There is a tag, RU (see  for specification. NZ rules would be roughly equivalent to Tromp-Taylor, as far as I know, just FYI), which defines the assumed overall rule set for the SGF. Any moves in the SGF which violate the specified rules could be considered illegal moves, perhaps making the SGF invalid. However, to say there's 'no concept' of ruleset in SGF is simply incorrect. As for the option to toggle scoring, it is definitely not obvious in the UI. I looked for it before posting this, although I was looking for changing the rule set, not for 'area vs. territory'. I'll look again.... Okay, that is definitely not obvious. Instead of being under Preferences or Game Info, you have to click on the score display within Score or Estimate, and the score certainly does not appear to be a button of any kind at first glance. Personally, I would try to follow the principles laid out in The Design of Everyday Things, by Don Norman, a very well-known design and usability researcher. For example, one of his principles is that a single control on an interface should ideally have a single function the score display violates this principle by acting as both a simple display and as a button, with no additional visual affordance to indicate that it might be a button (although mouse hovering does indicate this, but who would think to hover over the score display? I didn't, until prompted by your comment). Compare this with a hyperlink, which is also a clickable display object, but which provides the visual affordances of being a different colour to the surrounding text and is also usually with an adornment such as being underlined. Just my opinion.  @friend Perhaps you have a suggestion instead of criticizing with a quote from a 16 year old book? (Actually, the book is 30 years old. I wouldn't be surprised if things have changed since then. But then again, I haven't read that book, so I can't say for sure.) Previously, the button would only display 'Done', but I changed it so it would display useful information instead of just being a waste of space. Also, the data for both area and territory are visible, just the end result changes when you toggle between them. I agree there is a property for specifying the ruleset, but it shouldn't have an effect on someone who edits the game. That's what I meant by 'no concept'. It's only there for reference purposes, like game name/date, handicap stones, and copyright. That said, we could display the value of the property somewhere in game info.  It is meant as constructive criticism. It's a very good book, which is why it's still in print, and the principles are time-tested. Also, I didn't quote the book, but referenced it from my memory of it. My Computer Science degree was specialized in Human-Computer Interaction, and Don Norman is well-known in that field. That's how I know about the book, and why I read it. Also, I did give a concrete suggestion, but since I added it later as an edit, perhaps you missed it ... Which button are you referring to? I'm referring to the score display control that shows up when you do Estimate, and it shows, for example, something like ""W+50.5"", and when you hover over it, it says ""Details"". Clicking on that control/button brings you to the Score calculation dialog where you can finally select Area or Territory. It's this dual-purpose control that both displays the score and is also a Details button that I'm referring to. It doesn't sound the same as the Done button you're referring to. Just for reference, other Go UIs such as the WGo UI display both territory and area scoring when you select Count Score from its hamburger menu. The real issue here is that I was opening SGF files which had their RU tag set to 'Chinese', but Sabaki was showing scoring based on territory/Japanese, rather than area/Chinese. If the scoring defaulted to area for 'Chinese', and territory for 'Japanese', that would be better, IMO. Unless they are opening multiple SGF files, in which case, the users would expect that the 'score' should be based on the ruleset specified by the existing SGF. Games from different sources, or even the same source (such as OGS), can use different rulesets from one game to the next. If the user has to open up the SGF file in a text editor to discover what the ruleset is, and then locate the difficult-to-find Details/Score calculation dialog just to toggle to the right scoring method, that's a pretty big pain in the UI. Sabaki can easily figure out which scoring should be default and toggle to that. Or, alternatively, just show both scoring methods, each on its own line, when the user clicks Estimate. Presumably, it also specifies how the score in the game result property was calculated.  It's hardly constructive criticism, since you didn't say what exactly can be changed. Also I don't know the book and am hardly willing to read it just for you. Furthermore, I didn't study Human-Computer Interaction. Let's not argue about formal definitions. My argument still stands if you change one wording for another. I did indeed miss this, but please do explain yourself further. That's exactly the button I'm referring to. No contradictions here. And I think WGo can be customized either way. I'm not a fan of how opening an SGF file can change a user's setting. Also, if the score has already been calculated, there is no need to calculate it again with the scoring tool. This is actually a good idea.  But I did. Maybe not as directly as I could have, but here are examples from that comment ... Obviously, I didn't suggest for you to read it just for me. In fact, I didn't even suggest for you to read it at all. I simply referenced it by link so that you'd know what book I was referring to. If you were to read it, it would be for your own sake, obviously, not mine. I don't suggest people do things just for me in the first place. If I didn't care about the success of this project at some level, I wouldn't have posted anything here at all. It takes time and effort to write an Issue report and follow up on the comment thread. There are plenty of other things I could spend my time and effort on. I chose to contribute to this project rather than some other. You needn't have had to. I'm just explaining how I know about the book and what field it is typically associated with (though it's even more general than HCI). You seemed to be wondering why I referenced a 15-30 year old book. Hence, I explained why. But all of that is kind of irrelevant as to whether or not to support different Go rule sets, or how to make the scoring mode more accessible and usable. It's just background information. Actually, regarding whether I quoted the book or referenced it from memory, I'm not exactly sure what your argument is, to be honest. What would it matter either way? Not sure what else to say. Right now it has a single line saying Just make it two lines Okay then, that's the button that has two functions, and one of them is not obvious (being the Details button where scoring mode toggling is hidden). That's the button I'm suggesting to either  1) Make it two controls, a Score display, and a separate Details button, or  2) Make it more obvious it's a button by adding visual affordances to it, such as by making it a hyperlink instead, or  3) Don't hide the scoring method toggle inside it; instead put the scoring method toggle in Preferences or Game Info, or  4) Partially eliminate the need for a scoring method toggle by showing both area and territory scoring on the same panel, as above, or  5) Something else if you prefer. I wasn't pointing out a contradiction, I was giving an example of another Go UI that already partially eliminates the need for a scoring method toggle by simply showing both scoring methods simultaneously, as above, suggestion 4. I disagree with your assumption that the scoring method is a property of the user's settings. IMHO, it should be a property of the game's settings. Therefore, it can and should be different depending on the SGF file, because that's where the scoring method (i.e. rule set) is specified. IMHO. Maybe the user's settings could include a 'default scoring method' for when they make a new game from scratch, but when loading existing games, which used pre-determined (i.e. before the game even began) scoring methods, I think the UI should reflect the game's settings primarily, and the user's settings should only be a default, if the game has no rule set specified. IMHO, of course. (Just assume I have 'IMHO' tacked on at the end of each sentence.) I'm not sure what this is referring to. Perhaps you mean the final game result? Thanks, but it's not really my idea. It's Don Norman's (or rather, I got it from his book; he probably learned it somewhere else, I'm guessing), namely the principle that each user control should have only one obvious function -- the corollary being that if you need to put in two functions, put in two separate controls. It's not a 100% all the time thing, it's just a principle. But a good one. From a time-tested book by a well-known researcher and engineer. (In case you were wondering where I got it from. Whether you read it or not is not my concern.)  Anyway, to simplify this thread  Area      [W+50.5]    Toggle group status     [x] Territory [W+45.5] Don't like it since it takes up two lines instead of one.  Also, if the score has already been calculated, there is no need to calculate it again with the scoring tool.  Not sure what else to say. Scoring the game only makes actual sense if it is your own game, since finished SGF files already have the score in its result field. One can take an SGF file and start playing from somewhere in the middle with an engine and score the game their way.  I think the best way to avoid the double concern is to let the button show 'Details' and have another label to show the score for those who don't realize the 'visual affordance' I put into the button. In any case, I wanted some good reasoning to do something, not just a quote or a reference or whatever to a 'well-known researcher'. Controls which have more than one function are quite common nowadays. It's a great way to provide functionality without cluttering the UI. You just have to look at Apple's iOS, well-known for its design and UX.   While I appreciate everyone who takes their time with my projects, your second post wasn't constructive criticism at all despite your flimsy justifications and hit a nerve. Especially by referencing a book to avoid giving any reasons yourself raised a red flag in me.  Since this discussion went way out of hand and I do not want to discuss it any further, I will lock this issue. ",41,42,425,0,0.6666666666666666,343,6,y

And with how we render popups via a Portal, I am not sure we have to worry about the update allowing you to trigger a popup from other blocks of markup.  I think we're ready to go here.  Changing labels.  Any update on this? Modal is not usable.  @friend any issues tagged with  are open for anyone to submit PRs to fix. You are welcome to do so. Any info related to this and all issues will be shown above in the issue history. Based on reading this history, it looks like there are no open PRs yet.  Any chance your Modal documentation can be updated to reflect the modal placement issue?  In any case, it seems wise to add a warning on the docs homepage that Semantic UI React is not officially compatible with Semantic UI 2.3 yet, and that using the 2.3 css in combination with the latest react version is at your own risk until this issue is resolved.  Valid point @friend, @friend. Since this issue was not picked up quickly for work, I have submitted a quick PR to update the README.md in #2644 linking here to alert people until we get a patch on this. Fingers crossed, I am hoping to at minimum get the modal working with 2.3 over the weekend.  See #2657, I've made updates for  and . We need updates for  and  before we can ship it.  @friend I have some time blocked out tomorrow afternoon to tackle . Do you mind if I just add those commits into your PR branch? If I have the time I may also be able to tackle . I think there were a LOT of additions in this new version of FontAwesome so that might take a while, but I have not looked into seeing if there is an easy to parse list in the CSS on SUI somewhere yet.  @friend I've merged PR for  to , with generator, BTW smile_cat  There is a message for Modals in 2.3.1  In light of the release notes for 2.3.1 referenced above, it seems like support for either version of the modals is the long term strategy for SUI core styles. I need to dig in over there to find out for sure, but if this is the case, we'll probably have to go with my earliest proposal in this comment. If indeed there will be the ability to go either way on this in the styles, I'll make sure the PR has the above option for our modals as well.  I haven't received a reply yet on my question here for @friend so I think for now I am just going to proceed without some sort of legacy/fallback prop. I'll try to keep a close eye on whatever happens with modals in the next version of SUI since it sounds like there are going to be some additional breaking changes incoming. Starting a branch on this now in the office as I've blocked out some official work hours to get this working. PR should be up this afternoon.  To update on Modal positioning, see this comment from the linked issue in SUI  Quick fix for modal positioning, working here with SUI 2.3.1 &amp; SUIR 0.79.1 .visible.transition {   display unset !important; }  .dimmed.dimmable &gt; .ui.visible.dimmer, .ui.active.dimmer {   display -ms-flexbox;   display flex !important;   opacity 1; }   @friend, and for anyone landing here, I would recommend against what you have proposed for . Those classes are used for lots of other things in the SUI css, not just modals. A safer solution for anyone wanting to use the newest version of SUI styles and this incompatible version of SUIR would be safer doing the following There are other problems you'll encounter using the latest styles, but those above changes should at least fix modals. The last fix for this is coming in PR #2689.  This may be part of what @friend was referring to regarding Icons, but since the shift to FontAwesome 5, an error is being thrown for ""invalid"" icon names.  They are raising an error (it looks like) because SUI.js does not have the correct list of icon names for FA5.  Thankfully, the icons still show correctly on the page.  @friend those are only proptype errors. If you are not using another component broken by these changes and want to continue using a newer version of the CSS than we currently support until 2657 gets merged and deployed, you can just declare your icon names in the prop instead of the  prop on your  component.  What versions of semantic-ui-react and semantic-ui-css are sufficiently compatible with each other? It is very difficult for a newbie, like myself, to use this library when it is unclear which versions of libraries should be used together. Placing this information, if available, in the README would be a huge help.  currently compatible only with .  @friend Please take a look at the VERY first thing at the top of the README.md ",20,5,164,0.041666666666666664,0.08333333333333333,181,7,y

SevTech-Ages/DarkPacks/2977,0.0997041075,DarkPacks,SevTech-Ages,"A new player's experience, and a request for change.",35550,407,190,0.46153846153846156,1,"     Context I am trying to give feedback on what the pack is like for a new player, who has not played it before. I suspect that you have gotten so familiar with the pack that you don't even think about the experience of a new player. The most important player you have is the new player. If you do not get new players, you wind up with a declining population and eventual nothingness; additionally, new players recruit other new players. As a new player, this is what I have seen, that really seems to define the pack for me Go to a kitchen counter (you can do this as a thought experiment if you want), and clear a meter square surface. Use some tissue paper (or toilet paper), and divide it into 1' x 1' squares. Stand in front of it. Now, keeping your eyes straightforward, move your neck to where you are looking around at all 9 spaces. Notice how much head movement you have, notice how much work is involved. Now, just look at the whole table, and move your hand around all 9 spaces. Notice how much easier it is? This is without taking into account that the mouse movements needed to aim where you are looking at for the 3 spaces closest to you are actually much more exaggerated than for the others. An ""in-world crafting table"", or ""non-GUI interface"" is not ""more realistic"". It is denying the use of hands to do things. It is taking the worst choices of the interface and controls of Minecraft and magnifying their effect. And it completely eliminates the concept of saying, ""I'm focusing on the crafting table, I'm using my hands to place things on the table, and I'm going to look things up in the recipe book"". Good or bad, you have basically chosen to document the modpack and its recipes with JEI. And that documentation is lost as soon as you are using the work stump. The mod page for primal tech (work stump mod) claims that it has JEI support. Yet I don't see it in play. Now, let's look at these work stump, wooden hopper, chest, shelf (cupboard), water strainer. The basic operations on stores of inventory items are deposit one, deposit stack, remove stack, remove one, remove half stack. The documentation for what key/mouse commands do what is nonexistent. Each block seems to have a slightly different set of controls than the other blocks, and none of them are documented. If you make a mistake with the water strainer (taking out too much), you can't put the others back. If you try to take one repeatedly from either the wooden hopper, the chest, or the shelf you wind up placing the block that you just took out (because the control used is shift-place). Etc. (and why does the water strainer have an inventory GUI when nothing else at this tech level does?). ""Nonintuitive"" only begins to describe the pain of this system. I haven't even gotten to the strangeness of saying that there is an item you can craft at tech level tutorial that includes an item you can't understand, that can be made ""in hand"" in your 2 x 2 but not on the work stump. All of these ""in world"" non-GUI blocks essentially restrict you to only those items that you have room for in your hot bar. None of the rest of your inventory space is usable. My hot bar is almost always nearly full in normal play, and even so far in the pack I don't have much space in it. I want to bring up the issue of the chopping block again. I complained about the behavior of the chopping block. I was told, ""You tap attack on the chopping block..... stop wasting our time with these issues use discord...."". Nowhere in the documentation that I saw -- not the pages for the mods, not any instruction in the achievement tree, no tooltips for the chopping block, nothing -- is the ""tap attack"" mentioned. And this is so much in line with everything else in Minecraft, that you see this tap attack used ... to pick up mine carts. And I think only to pick up mine carts. It isn't the norm, I am used to other mods that distinguish between your activities based on where you are pointing at -- heck, vanilla will rely on where you are aiming when it comes to placing stairs or slabs -- and to have my ""bug report"" (and the behavior did seem very buggy and exceedingly nonobvious) dismissed and closed with that remark seems very much ""anti-new player"". And ""stop wasting our time""? Do you have any idea how much time I have been spending trying to find something worth playing in this pack? Do you have any idea how much time I'm spending reporting the problems and flaws I'm running into as a new player? Do you have any idea how much time anyone else that tries to pick up this pack is going to spend trying to deal with the interface strangeness? My observation so far is that while there appeared to be a very large amount of things to do in tech level tutorial, the reality is that the arrangement of the achievements is highly misleading, and tech level tutorial is really tiny; most of it is actually tech level 0. But even in zero, while there appears to be many things to do, all that really matters is the ""advanced to the next tech level"" path. Let me repeat that I am being trained, early in the game, that all that matters is advancing to the next tech level, and everything else at any given stage of the game is pointless. You have gone to a great deal of effort to make these tech levels, put content in them, and all I am learning is to skip them as quickly as possible. That's just bad. I like the idea of a detailed progression pack, complete with an actually complete progression chart. The last time I saw something like this was Jaded's packs. (My only exposure to non-vanilla skyblock was agrarian skies, and an entire section of her quest lines was a chapter on how to skyblock.). I have tried playing other quest packs that did not actually have enough information in the quest lines that you'd have any idea what you were actually trying to do or how to do it. I really do appreciate the large amount of effort (and having tried to make a quest pack once myself, I do mean that I recognize and appreciate the large amount of effort). I have been told by my friends -- both the one who encouraged the rest of us to play this, and the other one that has gone crazy with the musical ceremonies -- that the pack gets much more interesting once I get to the musical ceremonies. I've even discovered that there is a bit of balance issue -- a single person trying to generate enough music by themselves will have trouble on some of the more complicated ceremonies, but 4 people playing music together will find that all of them are trivial. I like the idea of being required to learn mods that I normally do not use -- because there actually is an in game training for these mods, which is usually the point missing from most mods. But if there is no reason to stay around at a given tech level, if the goal that I am learning is ""just advance to the next tech level, and get access to better, more advanced and more powerful mods"", then why? Would I recommend this pack to anybody else? Not based on what I've seen so far. Why am I trying to continue playing this pack? Only because I have 3 friends at tech level 2, and they are waiting for me to catch up so we can play together. And I'm going to ask them to put a standard chest, and a standard crafting table in my room so that I can at least reduce the amount of pain that I have while playing (and I'm going to take advantage of the fact that they already have a horse powered chopping block set up so that I never have to worry about that tap attack issue again). Or, you know, just rely on the fact that I have a water strainer to give me all the planks I need. How does that make any sense anyways?  I'll go over this in detail later on. But to clarify one thing until then. This was posted due to the fact you opened a tonne of petty issues on that day all of which lack details and you expected us to help/give support on little to now information. That and most of them are Discord issues. This tracker is for bug reports and mod suggestions not. This is why we have Discord it's open and more people can make an input on helping/teaching people. This is a hobby for myself and all the developers who make this pack. We're not going to waste our own time when working on the pack and then deal with issues which no effort was put into them or could have been dealt with in Disord. When we have pack testers, moderators and even the user base helping each other out. If you felt hurt by that then you need to understand that we're not going to spoon feed users on this tracker on how to do x or y. A lot of modpacks use new mods or mods which change mechanics which do lack documentation. But this is why those packs have Reddit's or Discord or even Forums where the community creates the documentation. One big example being this  like this was all done by the community. It's linked in Discord on our Wiki and even on top results for Google. But that's all I'm going to cover for the time being. I'll comment in regards to each section later but I wanted to hit this on the nail.  But to be clear this pack was designed for Sevadus. It's designed around him and how he wanted it. Nothing will change in regards to the advancements or layout. It's done to a spec which we met.  I mean concerning the issue of SevTech not explaining things but rather assuming the player knows or can easily figure them out, that is a bit of a problem. I had plenty of instances where how to do something simple wasn't detailed anywhere in SevTech, and I find myself constantly googling things from specific mods in order to use them. Most recent example would be making stabilized metal with an arc furnace. JEI only says I needed a hardened mesh, iron, and some refined hardeners. All JEI showed was that I needed all three in the same place, but it turns out the refined hardeners needed to be in the modifiers slots along with the iron ingots. Never would I have guessed that iron ingots were NOT what was being melted down to make stabilized metal, and instead were put in the modifiers slots instead of the smelting spots. I spent over an hour and a half pulling my hair out. Google was of little help this time because the recipe is different in SevTech than what it showed elsewhere and I had to eventually just rummage through random youtube videos concerning steve's carts until I noticed one from a streamer involved an arc furnace, and surprise surprise he spent almost half an hour on the stream trying to figure out how to make stabilized metal. Only when he eventually discovered iron ingots needed to be on the right slots instead of the left in the arc furnace was I then also able to continue with it myself. There's like, probably a dozen examples of SevTech progression-related advancements where it just says ""do this thing with this mod"" but it doesn't tell you how, or always give you that mod book. There's a few books from mods that you have to craft in order to try and learn about that mod. It doesn't help that SevTech starts off by giving you these books when you reach those points for free, and then stops entirely leading the player to believe there IS no book to help with that mod when in fact there is, you just need to browse JEI until you find it and craft it.  There's a lot to complain about in terms of SevTech teaching players what to do. Not just in the first two ages either. I'm in age 4 and pausing the game to go spend half an hour googling information that isn't obvious or clear to me in order to progress or acquire something exceedingly valuable is simply par for the course at this point. I've gotten used to it and I never thought about how stupid it was. It do in fact hate games that make me stop playing them in order to figure out how to continue playing them. A modpack for a game like Minecraft was probably always going to entail this, though. As for the I actually disagree. All those extra advancements are more a quality-of-life thing. They are pointless in the same vein that the mushroom islands or woodland mansions are pointless in vanilla minecraft. If you consider defeating the Ender Dragon and watching the end credits to be the ultimate goal, then there's an ENORMOUS amount of stuff in vanilla miencraft that's pointless, and only there if you want it or find it fun to invest your time into. SevTech does this but on steroids. I've skipped kitten kaboodles of advancements because they didn't interest me. Literally never even touched Steve's Carts. Didn't even make a cart or use any of the mod at all. Only acquired stabilized metal to get a mob duplicator for my mob farm.  I think that's fine. It allows you to select what you want to do, and only rarely forces you into mundane or tedious vague bullshit as a requirement to progress OCCASIONALLY.  For the most part, the age-progression content is straightforward enough. There's nothing wrong with focusing on ONLY the age progressions. I for one played that way intentionally for a good while, thinking once I had enough stuff unlocked, I'd simply come back and browse what I wanted, getting it later, which is in fact now what I'm doing; building a massive sky castle that will have absolutely everything I could possibly want or need now that the majority of SevTech and its mod contents are available to me.  If you were hoping for progression where you only advance after doing 100% of everything in that age, I would argue you don't know what you're asking for, because during age 0 and 1, I thought that's what I had to do (again because SevTech never told me that age progression advancements had a unique shape to their advancement icons) and it was a tedious nightmare doing this and finding that and completing something I cared nothing for just to try and continue. Overall SevTech isn't really good for player's who aren't already at least relatively familiar with a large handful of mods. It requires homework outside of the game in order to keep going further, yes. I don't like it much either in that manner. It's more a serious of mods strung together with the idea of one unlocking the next, rather than something that was delicately crafted to provide the player the complete and total experience from several of the best mods available in the pack in as smooth and convenient a way as possible.  In my opinion, PrimalCore and Immersive Craft are mostly meant (and to some extent Embers, Immersive Tech, Blood Magic -- basically anything without a GUI) to be used with VR goggles. What otherwise is tedious to use becomes the more agreeable way with VR.  I was all for trying this modpack out, and I look at all of the stuff and I'm like ""wow, this looks actually cool."", and then I get to the crafting stump.  Words cannot describe my hatred for the crafting stump. I have tried several things to get my items to go into the right spaces and even tried moving around it. I understand that there is a front side, I've moved to it. I've watched videos about it for christ's sake and I still couldn't get it to work. I tried doing my homework although everything didn't even work. The achievements didn't even play properly. I made my crafting stump and I was like ""oh, chopping block for planks."" so I made that and suddenly I just then got the achievement for it and the crafting stump (which only THEN let me advance to age 0). Same thing happened for when I broke a log with my hand, and then later made a fire stick, and THEN made a axe, I got the achievement for making fire (which I hadn't done), and breaking the log with my hand, and then the axe achievement.  I deliberately waited a week before replying, because I wanted to make sure that I had a chance to look at this from a point of calmness. Every place that takes bug reports says, break your bug report up. One bug report per issue. Lots of tiny reports. A big report is hard to work with, because no-one wants to start it, because it will take forever to complete. Lots of tiny reports. Were my reports actual ""help, I need support, how do I solve this""? No. They were ""this is broken."". Mipmaps causing problems. Identified in a Forge pull request as mods doing the equivalent of a graphic state push, alteration, and no balancing graphics state pop. A Forge pull request to catch it and fix it by Forge so that you don't need to worry about fixing every single mod that's messing up. Definitely a mod bug, but no clear idea which mod was messing up. Now fixable with a Forge upgrade. (Entirely separate we are warned not to try to upgrade Forge ourself in this pack, because that will break something else). Flint not flaking every single time. Turns out this is apparently expected. Not every attempt to make a flake gets a roll, and you won't always succeed at your attempt. So you have to attempt multiple times, and you're going to have losses. This is not documented, but is expected behavior. A complaint about how items that you pick up off the ground go into your hot bar, and then get dropped as you move your mouse wheel. ""Works as intended"". I'm getting advancements that I haven't earned. ""Eh, we can't fix it"". The hiding of things that you can't detect failing in the case of ore samples. ""Known, but we can't fix it"". Oh, not closed as duplicate, not closed as can't fix, not closed as won't fix, but as ""invalid"". An issue where a new player does not even see the work stump, because of how the advancements are laid out. Along with the comment of ""Okay, now I see it"". Closed without comment. A follow-up report where I say, ""the flint pickaxe trio shows up well before the work stump, even though it cannot be made until after the work stump. This is confusing."". A response of basically, ""we can't do anything about this, this is how the person responsible wants it"". Another report about the Spear and Tomahawk being oddly placed in the achievements, and asking for flaked flint points to be made a tutorial-level item. Closed without comment. Reporting an inconsistency in the way that the spear and tomahawk display information compared to everything else. ""As intended"". 2 different reports about problems making use of just enough items features with work stumps. ""You just don't. You have to deserve it."" A report about getting information on Galactic craft at age 0, instead of something more appropriate (I'm guessing age 4). Closed without comment. A complaint about having to pulse attack to make planks. ""You tap attack on the chopping block..... stop wasting our time with these issues use discord...."". And in this thread, you made it clear that you thought I was asking for support. Not reporting problems. Please take a look at what I have written here tonight. Do you see how a new player, who has never seen this pack before, and is trying to play it through, is going to get very discouraged very quickly? ""That and most of them are Discord issues. This tracker is for bug reports and mod suggestions"" -- WHICH EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE IS. Discord is a horrible support tool. Compared to forums, Discord is a horrible support tool. There is effectively no history. There is no way to have any type of ongoing discussion about a topic. There is no way for people to comment on the same topic a day later, and be read and understood by somebody a week later. There is next to no ""pinned topic"" feature like there is in forums. You can pin single messages, but there's no way to respond to them. There is zero expectation that messages posted in Discord will be seen by anybody with the ability to deal with it. High-volume, high noise level, low signal-to-noise value, no organization, and nothing keeping track of what an administrator has/has not yet read, at least nowhere near the degree to which a forum does. ""We're not going to waste our own time when working on the pack and then deal with issues which no effort was put into them or could have been dealt with in Disord."" No effort? No Effort? NO EFFORT? Every single issue that I reported, excluding only the flint flaking, I mentioned how to work around the problem that I found. With flint flaking, there was no workaround because the only problem was the documentation. You complain that I don't put any time into this? I do. You complain that I don't make any effort to solve the problems on my own? I do. More than anything else, it is this dismissal that infuriates me. But none of this is the real problem. Let me restate that. TL; DR none of this is the real problem. ""But to be clear this pack was designed for Sevadus. It's designed around him and how he wanted it. Nothing will change in regards to the advancements or layout. It's done to a spec which we met."" This is the real issue. Do you not see it? Then let me spell it out. Sevadus is the one who has to approve changes. That means any issues with the modpack ultimately need to go to him. Not to you. Trying to report any issue to you is pointless; the only one that matters is somebody who isn't even here, doesn't read these reports, doesn't get reports sent upstream to him from you for his comments, and is completely out of the loop. So why is this issues thing even here? Why do you have an issues section on this GitHub, when ultimately you can't actually do anything? When you just want us to use discord? "" It doesn't help that SevTech starts off by giving you these books when you reach those points for free, and then stops entirely leading the player to believe there IS no book ..."". Well, no apparently, the first person on a server to reach an age where there is a book will get the books for free. Other players don't, and if they aren't aware that the mod has a book, they are clueless. Even worse, imagine seeing a whole bunch of new things show up in your achievements, and not seeing anything at all about backpacks. Absolutely no clue that backpacks have opened up for you. In a modpack that basically triples the number of items that there are to collect. That you need. When your chest/storage space ability has been crippled. ""I'm in age 4 and pausing the game to go spend half an hour googling information that isn't obvious or clear to me in order to progress or acquire something exceedingly valuable is simply par for the course at this point. I've gotten used to it and I never thought about how stupid it was. "". Isn't this basically the point of a quest line? Sorry, an achievement line? I was ready to give up on this completely. My friends basically apologized for rushing through, and rushing ahead so quickly. One of them got to age 3 in a solo world, (during her time off from medical school), and introduced this pack to the rest of us. Another got to age 2 in a solo world in something like 10 days. (As he says, he has no life). The 2 of them worked together with the 3rd person, and they all got at least half way through age 0 during the first week of part-time play while I was still trying to connect my own machine. I tried to progress on my own, trying to catch up with them. By the next weekend? The one with no life had split off from the rest of the group, made his own base, and advanced to age 1. I was struggling with basics. By the end of that weekend, no life was up to age 2, everyone else was up to age 1, we had a teleport network built between our bases, I was trying to make string (and at this point I don't even remember what it was that I needed the string for), and was trying to put down enough torches to safely light up our area, only to realize that instead of one block of wood making 8 sticks making 32 torches, one block of wood might make 6 sticks which makes 2 torches. And a mass of giant trees took more than 3 work blades to de-leaf (because you get more sticks from work blade de-leafing than you do from decay), absolute full of pain and anguish, taking a massive amount of time, and only later do we discover that there's apparently a tool in age 0 that takes the leaves off of a large area of trees in almost no time. If it was just me, I'd already be gone. My friends have convinced me that the pack isn't quite so bad if you have someone to lead you through it, and the other comments in this thread tell me that other people need to be led through it. So the quest line/achievement lines are not sufficient, and the person who made this pack is happy with that. That stinks. I'll probably make videos of my play through and learning, with the goal of being a ""how-to"" for the people who come after me, because this pack badly needs it.  Well I mean... and only later do we discover that there's apparently a tool in age 0 that takes the leaves off of a large area of trees in almost no time.` Eeeeeyup. Definitely everything SevTech is about. It's a Minecraft-themed Homework Simulator.  When I was getting through age 3, I was making a bee-line for the age advancements to breach age 4, hoping blindly it would unlock diamonds by age 4 because why in the world would diamonds be exclusive to an age that prioritizes space travel? How are diamonds more valuable than literal rocket-science?  I wanted them because in the Cyclic book, I read about diamond spikes, which were the first item I discovered that apparently would act as a player-kill. Already having a small, rather inefficient mob farm built by that point, all I wanted were those diamond spikes so I could turn my mob farm into an experience farm as well. Come age 4 after some grueling and nightmare-ish progression grinding and googling and video watching and building and rebuilding when I realize I built it wrong and all the hullabaloo that comes with stupidly vague SevTech progression... I discover diamonds are in fact age 5 not 4, but browsing through JEI, I noticed mob grinding utils is now unlocked... which comes with mob-killing items that drop experience, and dark utilities now has a ""player trap"" which does the same thing as diamond spikes.  My ultimate goal was wisped away from me due to lack of SevTech information, and then immediately returned to me through another avenue via lack of SevTech information.  This is unfortunately how the whole experience is, honestly. You will have a suckish time if you don't constantly browse and research what is newly available. SevTech seriously seriously VERY EXTREMELY BADLY NEEDS a feature where it lists to you all the items unlocked by age, and also provide links to resources players will end up likely googling anyway just to try and learn more about a mod they are using. Since SevTech has so many mods, it needs to compensate for this massive overflowing incline of a learning curve it now results in, and provide players something more comprehensive.  Something to list what each age unlocks (only available after you reach that specific age). Way more detail about where to find more information concerning a mod (I.E. does the mod have a book the player can craft? Or should they default to googling and thus be provided a link from an in-game description instead?). SevTech is very anti-player-friendly.  Though to be honest, apathetic-looking github management and poor/nonexistent in-game teaching methods aside... I just want the damn modpack to work again. Seriously, whatever happened with the 3.0.8 update has made it so incredibly unfun to play SevTech with how unstable it is now that I may not ever have the motivation to actually make it to age 5.  Literally a complete rollback to 3.0.7 would be 100% acceptable to me at this point, because at least the modpack can be played in a heavy setting again, such as large builds or complicated surroundings (which, you know... age 4 and 5 will basically demand from the player anyway). Unfortunately, we may just be barking at a bush from the perspective of the people involved in sevtech development. If it was made primarily to meet a specific guy's standards, I doubt anybody but him coming forward and saying ""shit needs a lot of work, yo"" is gonna do anything besides fall on deaf ears.  The 'poor me' that these posts are dripping with is infuriating, since it would unprofessional for the Dev Team to excoriate you, I'll step up. Most of this complaining is stupid.  You're complaining about lack of documentation, that is the Forge/Modded world in general.  Very few mods have 'user level' documentation, most tutorials that I have seen, have been from people taking the time to either have in-depth QA with the author, reading the API, or just experimenting. If you want your hand held through a puzzle pack, find a new hobby, this isn't for you.   Seriously, at worst SevTech is breaking your ego because you have forgotten what it's like to not know something about MineCraft.  I just started Modded this past Winter, as such, with every new pack there are different mods for me to learn.  SevTech merely took every thing you thought you knew and turned it on it's head, and you are butt hurt because you feel like a noob, and you're acting like a child, grow up. This was a commissioned work.  I am glad that the Dev Team and Sevadus have made this work public, it's challenging with many paths to achieve overall completion.  I am having fun with it.  It is frustrating with some of the changes to mechanics that are not apparent, but the Discord community is extremely helpful and courteous. Most of the issues you have brought up, are your issues.  There has not been anything in this pack that I have not found information on by watching Streamers, YouTubers (both mod tutorials and SevTech LP), or by reading/asking on Discord. It might simply be this mod pack is not for you, but that is all on you not the Dev Team.  There are 1200+ other mods and 2000+ video games released every year, and if that's still not for you, Crayola might have something more your speed.  Sorry, no. Number one this is a pack with custom recipes, and custom unlocks. It's not just ""look up the docs for a mod"". It's ""trying to figure out what was changed specifically for this pack"". Number 2 Again requiring Discord to have any clue about what you're doing is the wrong idea. Number 3 Please re-read what you just wrote. Assume that that was written to you, instead of by you. Would you consider that to be insulting? I did. Number 4 You are not Sevadus. We have already established that this pack is one person's view, as implemented by a team. Not you. You do not have the authority to make the declarations you just made. They are your opinions only, yet you want to treat them as absolute truths. Please re-read what I said after my TL DR. You have just described the mods that I don't use or play with. If I am looking at potentially hundreds of mods, I am not going to spend 30 minutes to 2 hours on each one evaluating it. Mods that I play with are mods where the forum post explains enough of what the mod does/how it does it, and if it has a wiki, it's not just an empty skeleton for the users to populate, but an actual info dump from the author of the mod. Conversion modpacks? I've played a couple. My minimum standard is around the level of agrarian skies. That wasn't perfect, but it was good enough. Resource limited maps like skyblock in vanilla Minecraft make you think, but you're working with what you know. Maps where you start with essentially one sapling, some useless ground, and a bunch of mods you might have never played with, and then say ""go study these mods for another 3 hours; we won't tell you which mods to look at, we won't tell you what your goal is, and your only clue is to come from someone else who has already gone through this and figured it out"" are nothing more than distributed time wasting. This pack is right in the middle. It is distributed time wasting, but hey, at least we were clearly pointed at totemic upon entering age 0. Except for the things that we weren't pointed at, like absolutely no hint that there are backpacks in this pack. This is not ""poor me"". This is ""I think this is bad design, and here is why."" The response is basically ""only one person has the authority to say I agree, or I disagree, and that person isn't here"".  JEI has literally EVERY RECIPE in the pack.... so whats the problem?   It's even setup in a manner where, if it's not in JEI, you can't make it.... yet. No one said Discord was required. I offended you? Working as intended.  Your OP is offensive given that you paid exactly nothing for SevTech but have the gall to stand up on a soap box and complain about, how a group of hobbyists did not make this pack for the general population.  As you have repeated pointed out, the pack was made for Sevadus.  Since you haven't paid money for the pack,  they are under no obligation to do anything.  Yet your attitude is that of someone that paid money for a product and is expecting a much higher tier of support.   This make you and entitled jerk. I have perused all of your tickets... honestly most of them are just a difference of opinion, and you, in this post come off as your opinion should have more weight than it really does.   The remainder are issues with the behavior of a specific mod which would need to be taken up with the mod author, not the pack author.   Based on some of the responses... you need to learn how to use the search/filter button. This issue tracker is for things not working as the AUTHOR intended, not how you think it should be, nor how you would have done it. You also mention that you're playing as part of a group... why are you not using the group mechanics? This pack has a theme, a structure that was intended from the outset.  Your opinion on implementation does not matter in the slightest.  You were not the intended audience.  Hello, I have refrained from commenting here as I think the issue has become a little inflamed with a fair bit of rhetoric and complaining. I am the author of the mod that at first orders has annoyed you so much. ""All of these ""in world"" non-GUI blocks essentially restrict you to only those items that you have room for in your hot bar. None of the rest of your inventory space is usable. My hot bar is almost always nearly full in normal play, and even so far in the pack I don't have much space in it."" This is part of the reason we made these blocks. Why should you be entitled to vanilla inventory management in a hugely modded pack? I was asked to make blocks that worked without guis and were more 'primitive' than the vanilla blocks you unlock later. This was the objective to making players appreciate even the most simple of vanilla blocks once more. ""Good or bad, you have basically chosen to document the modpack and its recipes with JEI. And that documentation is lost as soon as you are using the work stump. The mod page for primal tech (work stump mod) claims that it has JEI support. Yet I don't see it in play."" OK this is a technical problem that involves several mods, of which none of us has a viable solution to fixing. The mod for the most part has JEI support for recipes, but the workstumps are a special case that cannot be added due to restraints on game stages, JEI and Primal tech (as well as other mods) with auto-crafters. The complaints about the placing mechanics are just that, complaints - sorry but I like it and it does what it needs to; limits the player from just throwing a load of things in to a gui with shift clicks and magically pulling out an item. I'm sure many of the things you deem 'unplayable' in the pack are more annoyances than game-breaking, so I'll leave it there at the risk of a wall of text (whoops too late). Cheers, Me.  Okay, that's quite enough of this. This has gone well out of proportion and you guys are now at each other's throats. ",74,7,1074,0.5384615384615384,0,776,34,y

Use a random UUID for users both locally and in the DB if needing to identify the users so part of phone number isn't exposed.

asmjit/asmjit/231,0.365598625,asmjit,asmjit,Donations,7754,143,63,0.6,1,"I do not recommend donating to this project, we have donated a few times to them and now they have removed information about it. Our money wasn't good back then Petr when nobody supported your project?  Why the sudden change of heart?  Cheap shot dude...  I tried to solve this privately instead of making it a community thing as this was rather personal, however, the communication didn't end up well. The sudden change was of course not meant positively. I think that in any way we should stay civilized here and don't let misunderstanding or anger change how we react or behave to each other.  Read above.  I think sharing the whole communication would be more transparent since you already started this nonsense.  Sure thing, here you go, after I made a donation I sent you the link to my site How's that a paid ad, when you wanted to put it yourself as a thank you for the first donation? Don't you even feel bad, accusing me of something that didn't even happen? In 2016 I wanted to advertise in AsmTK project for 150 EUR, but you refused (you didn't want to make this kind of affiliation with me, whatever that means), that was the only case I wanted to pay for a link.  I thought I didn't remember the facts correctly in our recent emails, but the good thing I had it all saved and I don't feel guilty, because at first I thought I have paid for the link in AsmJit project, but now we all can see you came with that yourself.  For documentary purposes I'm attaching the whole communication here, because I think it's important for understanding the context. I thought about handling this differently, but I have a weird feeling that it ended like this in all alternative universes. I would also like to say ""sorry"" to the community. In my opinion this issue should have never been opened and the community of open source project should not be used as a jury in a personal dispute between 2 people. My proposal of fixing this is simple. Since I don't have the information to transfer the donated money back (no more PayPal), I would like to donate the same amount in BTC to some other open-source project on behalf of PELock. I thought about x64dbg as they seem to have a good relation with Bartosz and accept crypto. [So here is the communication] I don't think a comment under a commit is a proper way of establishing communication between us about something like this. I don't think making such communication public makes sense as nobody can verify what happened anyway, so what did you try to accomplish? I already calculated it (below) and just wanted to verify the final amount with you. I never said you haven't donated or miscounted the number of donations, so please let's not turn this into something it isn't. I'm not trying to play any card here. I'm trying to make us even in a polite way so we both can move on without a feeling that one owes something to the other. Remember that it was you who started this publicly. So if this stays public then I would like to disclose the amount as i think it's very important considering what you wrote in that issue. So as a result I want to return you what you have invested, because I disagree with your methods and the way you started dealing with it. You have no information about the number of donations that I have received nor their amounts, so please stop these speculations. For your own information - donations are symbolic to me - they are nice and I'm glad when somebody appreciates my work, but it's more about the appreciation than finance to me. I would not be working on asmjit or other open source projects if I wanted to make more money. I love sharing my work and I don't demand anything in return. After all of this I don't want to keep the money and that's what I'm trying to tell you. I don't even insist on sharing any details of the issue publicly if we can just resolve it quickly and quietly without further escalation. For me this is not worth it, it doesn't move the project anywhere, and it distracts me from other work that I wanna do. So please let's do the right thing to finally resolve this so we can move on. [[Reply - PELock]] Hello Petr, Is anything from this list false?  I have donated 3 times without requesting anything in return I have donated one time for the link (2nd donation) Fine, you could remove the link, I agree with that So why do you keep the donations list if I'm not there (just a name)? You don't want the money but you gladly accepted it back then  It just seems you're not very decent and honest person. I have supported many, many reversing and programming projects and this is the first time someone doesn't want to mention the donor just because he has the money now. This is another definition of low level. [[Reply - Petr]] I'm kindly asking you to read again what I have written. I believe the outcome would be different if we started the whole thing differently, but now it's too late to do that, because I just don't like where this went and I don't want to make it worse. I would really appreciate if you send me the IBAN so we can finally resolve this and move on. I'm asking you like third time and you keep only adding more stuff that I'm not interested in. I really don't understand why you make such a drama out of it. We have different opinions and that's it, life goes on, no need to judge others and complicate it. [[Reply - PELock]] Hello Petr, And I don't understand why is it so big problem for you to leave donors names on your page (I'm not asking for the link), does it hurt your feelings or what? Are you ashamed to take donations? If so and you want to be true to yourself you should remove this sections completely, because you don't even know how to handle it properly. I want you to keep the money and think how dishonest your actions are. You deserved donations back then, if I knew how vile person you are I wouldn't donate a cent to you. Please don't write to me again.  I never paid for any advertisement, I thought I did because you said so in the recent emails and it was 9 years ago, but as we all can see you came up with this idea first. If you are so stubborn to NOT include my name on your donors list, even if I supported your project from day one, just because you are angry that I showed you were wrong and donations didn't have any strings attached, it's just another reason to not make any donations to you or any of your projects, because you are dishonest person and you have your supporters for nothing.  Maybe linking  would help others understand why I have refused your donations after 2016 and why I think this couldn't end up differently.

I tried creating an async task that would simply try to open a new channel with a timeout. If the timeout exception is raised, I assume the connection is down then try to restart a new connection. The problem in this case is that I can't seem to stop the old consuming task. Calling the .close() method on the connection or channel blocks forever when the connection is down, as does a call to .cancel() on the consumer. Do you have any thoughts on how a lost connection can be detected, and consumers rebooted with the new connection? Thanks for all the work you are doing on this.  I think there are a few related issues here  When a TCP connection unexpectedly drops, there's no exception to notify application code of the error. When the TCP connection has dropped, you can't manually  a connection. When the TCP connection has dropped, you can't manually  a channel. When the TCP connection has dropped, you can't unsubscribe existing consumers.  Regarding point 1. Error handling in async code is generally quite complicated (where should the exception go if all your application code is currently idle?).  approaches the issue by allowing you to register an exception handler with the event loop - so in theory all  needs to do is raise an appropriate exception when the connection is lost, and then you can use the loop's exception handler to build any application-specific retry logic. I happen to know that the transport calls  when the socket dies. It looks like our  doesn't override that method. I think all it needs to do is  - I'll accept a pull request (with tests) which addresses that (I may get some time to work on it tomorrow but I can't make any promises). Points 2-4 seem related to me (though I split them up because they may require separate fixes). Thinking out loud - I guess that those three methods try to send a frame over the wire to the server, which blocks forever because the socket is dead. I suppose one option would be to throw an exception when you try to send data through the protocol if the connection has been lost, and do some sort of ""emergency shut-down"" of any live objects or tasks which assume the connection is still open. In general, 's error handling capabilities have room for improvement. Thanks very much for raising the issue smiley Sorry for the guesswork-filled reply, my brain has not been in AMQP mode for a while so the neural pathways have crusted up a bit wink  I took a quick look through the code, and have a few thoughts I figured I'd bounce off of you. 1) I think raising a custom error and allowing the client to install a base error handler to handle a reconnection is the right approach. It seems to me that there are two places that should raise this error. The  method as you mentioned, but also inside 2) Things seem to block waiting on responses from the server inside of . It seems reasonable that if a connection is closed, there's no point in awaiting on anything so an exception should be set inside each future in each Syncroniser. The problem is that each connection needs to know about each Syncroniser in use in order to do that. I haven't totally digested how it's broken up, but I think the intial connection will have it's own Syncroniser, then each channel, and again each queue. I'm guessing that we would store a list inside each protocol instance and pass a reference to each channel/queue so that they can register any Syncronisers created with the connection. Then, when the heartbeats time out, or the connection_lost callback is triggered a set_exceptions method is called on each registered sycnroniser for that protocol instance(connection). Then each function that could be awaiting will have to look for the exception and handle it appropriately. I'd be happy to try to put together a pull request with tests, but I want to get your take on how things should be done before I get too far into it.  I agree with what you say in point 1. Regarding point 2, a little extra architectural knowledge off the top of my head might help. Each channel (including the connection, which is defined by AMQP to be channel 0) is essentially an actor with an inbox of frames from the server. The channel autonomously pulls frames out of the inbox and processes them using the correct method in the . The  is basically the entry point for a channel to process a frame. The inbox is implemented as a  - there is one queue per open channel; these are managed by the . So when a frame arrives, the  tells the  to put the frame in the queue of the correct channel. The  is basically an implementation detail of the handler; it keeps track of which objects on a channel are waiting for which frames and notifies them when a frame arrives. It mediates between API classes such as  and the objects which respond to the server (the s). So given all that, I think that error handling should respect the current architecture and go via the  and the . I think the right way to go is to add a special type of message which shuts down the actor (this is usually called a ""poison pill"") and a corresponding method on the  to respond to it. I guess this method would tell its  to kill all of its currently-live . The downside of this approach is that the poison pill message has to wait in the inbox until everything before it in the queue has been processed, which could cause problems if those messages block or if  never gets called - though I don't think that'll be too much of an issue in practice. That sounds like quite a lot of work to me. If you want to submit a pull request for part 1 (raising exceptions from the  when the connection dies) and leave part 2 (the poison pill message) to me then I'm fine with that. But if you fancy a challenge then I'll be very happy to accept a contribution for each of them!  I missed the . Since it's in communication with the Syncroniser already, a poison pill sounds like a much better approach than collecting references to the Syncronisers directly. I'm a bit busy with work just now to work on either, but I'd like to help. Depending how things go I may have a chance to look at this next week.  I submitted two pull requests today. The first contains the asynqp to the code and tests, the second contains an example program that automatically reconnects.  Meh, failed flake8, those pesky empty spaces on blank lines. I'll fix and submit new merge requests  Yup, builds passing now.  Closed by #19 ",32,0,175,0.4444444444444444,0,114,3,n

For what it's worth - which isn't much given that it's over half a year ago - it looks to me like your device is on the blink. The fact you had generation errors in your free space cache implies that your drive is returning outdated data for some sectors. I don't think this was caused by my driver, so I'm going to close the issue.  It‚Äôs an SSD drive which has not otherwise exhibited problems. Normally, I spend all of my time in Linux. However, I was doing some porting work and I was using Windows intensively during a month or two, without booting Linux. I remember receiving BSODs caused by WinBtrfs. I commented on another issue about the BSODs - #87. After I was finished with windows and booted back into Linux, I found the partition completely hosed as described above. Don‚Äôt you think that a natural conclusion is that WinBtrfs caused this?  No, I don't think that. If there were bugs in the checksumming or data-writing code, you'd see errors all over, not just in one or two sectors like your logs suggest. Furthermore, the BSODs are almost certainly a consequence rather than a cause of the corruption, if indeed they're related at all. From what I know about SSDs, they internally relocate sectors when they realize they are bad, which is why it looks okay to you now. I'd still get a new one, though.  This was just a small fraction of the logs.  The errors indeed were all over the place. WinBtrfs was gradually corrupting my partition. I remember logging into Linux before it got completely hosed and I remember Linux Chrome complaining about a corrupted profile directory. After some more time in Windows, I could not log in into Linux and got stuck at the login screen (the messages above from 8 months ago). The next stage of corruption was the mount failure (7 months ago). When I uninstalled WinBtrfs, no more BSODs, no more corruption. Which one causes the other (BSODs and corruption) is not clear to me as I have zero experience writing FS drivers, but to me it looks that everything is pointing towards WinBtrfs because it was correlated with it being installed.

Teaching is a specific activity, separate from ""normal"" github use.  These repositories and accounts should only be visible in github after specifically logging in through/doing a procedure from the ClassRoom interface, i.e. the place we sent the invitations to create private repos in the first place. At the minimum we need a global ""filter all ClassRoom related"" on personal setting of github profile or something, so teachers can also do research. I realize this is an interaction between how ClassRoom uses github to mascarade teaching into a git image. It is still a messy bug in the sense that I would need to open a second github account specifically for teaching at this stage, but I like my account. To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior  Use github for normal github usage  develop open source Enroll into classroom Click on 'Send Assignment Link' to about 100+ students, 3 weeks in a row Add a github filter to your mailbox Connect to github, try to find any of your repositories in the ""repos"" search box. Admire the fact the bar is trailing off screen  Expected behavior These accounts/repositories should not be visible under github unless I explicitly am doing ""teaching/grading"", i.e. accessing github through ClassRoom provided links. Screenshots see attached  Additional context I have a lot of students.  Hey @friend, this is behavior is managed in GitHub.com and therefore we are not the best place report this to. The best you can do is contact GitHub support about this  Sorry but I must disagree, misbehavior comes not from github itself, but from interaction with classroom. It's blocking/limiting use of your classroom software. Yes it is on the borderline but just saying it's not your problem and closing issue is not constructive.  I feel I am not the one that has to setup collab with github services to get them to ackowledge problem, from my pov it comes from use of ClassRoom not github.You're all the same company, sort it out, or not and we look for service elsewhere.  @friend GitHub Classroom is built on the GitHub API, it does not alter the functionality of github.com. When you connect an organization to Classroom, we automatically create student repositories for you from your GitHub account. As such, all of the repositories will be visible from your GitHub account. While I understand why you might want this, it is not something that we can change. ",9,0,62,0,0.42857142857142855,69,0,y

If you want it, extract it from the appropriate github release.  Hey,thank you for your prompt reply. According to your use case, I think I am missing something. How do I import the client side version of coffeescript from the Npm package?  You wouldn't. You can use bower to install CoffeeScript (including the browser build) or just fetch one of the release tarballs. npm distributes the files that are meant to be consumed by node when CoffeeScript is installed globally or as the dependency of a node project.  I disagree.Today npm modules are not only used for node project, but for frontend dependencies as well. See angular, jquery, hammerjs, moment, minim and so on. But I respect your position; that is why the fork button actually exists ;)  If you're using CS for browser code, then use browserify with coffeeify.  Making the user take the performance hit of local transpilation is probably a bad idea.  Hey,I am already using webpack with coffee-script loader, but I have a live editing part that should be transformed in the browser. Thanks anyway for the tip.  In that case...  You can point npm to the github address, and it will download master.  That should have what you need.  I am afraid it won't do the trick.  file still gets respected. Tested with npm install jashkenas/coffeescript#master npm install jashkenas/coffeescript#2d1a6fa6ec76b4e721da7e5e4a9c6b90172309ae  I wonder if it makes sense to publish a separate entry in npm for just this one thing?  Just musing...  npm is just not the right tool for the job here. Bower or cURL/tar are what you want.  Michael, are you sure of that? Personal experiences? Documentation?  Yep, that article basically makes the point for me. They point out a bunch of the pain points of using npm for managing front-end dependencies and show how bower solves those better. Package managers are designed with specific contexts, use cases, and distribution models in mind. npm wanting to be the single package manager for all things JavaScript is laughable.  Ok, I see your point of view and I respect it. Thanks! ",8,0,70,0.07692307692307693,0.3076923076923077,51,6,n

This behavior occurred originally in FS17 courseplay and was fixed in FS17 courseplay.

The CP folks are THE last group of modders that I'd want to piss off. I won't play FS without CP. I suggest you clarify whatever issue you might be having.  I think he mentioned #3142 doing this in this way is a pure disgrace ...  Mod team cannot read english submissions ? your comment has nothing to do with them reading English , its about harvesters. I'm new to CP and to be honest I think they have done a great job so far, it makes the game more playable and less boring. Ok yes there are some issues with the mod but at the end of the day its a mod and not a game, these people who make mods make them in their own time without getting paid. Its a free addition to the game which imo think its a must have for any serious player it just adds so much more time for you to do other things while the bots take care of all the jobs you hate doing, have a bot plough a field and another harvest another field while you go and tend to the animals. I think the authors deserve a little more respect for taking the time to create such a mod, bare in mind they can only add things or fix bugs when they have time to do it, they might be working at least 10 hours a day for all we know and only have a couple of hours to look at the mod. As I said i'm new and played FS17 without CP, it was only when a friend mentioned it to me a couple of weeks ago that I decided to take a look at it , and tbh I would miss it if it disappeared as for now i'm used to using it and it would feel like half of the game is missing without it.  Please let's not turn this into FS-UK/OxygenDave scene. @friend You mistake a code repository issue tracker with a forum. Please clearly post an in-game mod issue following the guidelines here. @friend @friend let's close this and move on?  combine harvester's ""cutting width"" seems to be located either at the back of the harvester or the ""start mark"" for entering a field is too close to the actual cutter location and they are charging right past the first mark of the field into the field to drop the cutter in and start at the second mark unless you back them way up and sometimes they STILL skip the first mark.  Manually setting to ""nearest"" instead of next resolves the issue I was told by the person who ""handled"" the issue the first time that there is a front-to-rear adjustment on the location of the tool/cutting position and there is NOT.

Be aware that IPGroups cannot have edit typer permissions, just read permissions.  Waiting for #1380 to be fixed before we can test.  Related, possibly a duplicate #3105  Today @friend @friend @friend and I discussed IP groups and I've been asked to try to reproduce this bug in the branch that pull request #3103 is based on. It's believed this is still a bug.  I can easily reproduce this bug by giving an IP Group ""admin"" on an unpublished non-root dataverse, which should result in the ""Guest"" user being able to see a search card for the unpublished dataverse. Interestingly, the indexing seems fine. The unpublished dataverse in question says it's discoverable by the IP Group The problem is at runtime we need a method in Dataverse to provide a list of all the IP Groups that a user (such as Guest) is a member of. This strongly reminds me of the  method I introduced in pull request #3062 but in the code you can see I wrote . Sadly, it seems the answer is no and since @friend is in town I plan to see if he can help with this.  Some initial progress in e6438c7 but a bit rushed. Ideally I'd add some API tests.  This is working now. Phil, we can close this unless there is something more you want to do.  @friend I'm glad to hear e6438c7 helped. It's in pull request #3103.

Good job folks! Here's an enhancement idea. Allow the user to create a rollup that concatenates string fields with a space after the delimiter. My challenge was that I needed to concatenate together some text that will be pulled from Salesforce into a form letter. Currently there is not an obvious way to add a space in the appropriate place, and my concatenated text looked like this State Florida - $25,000,State Michigan - $31,695,State Oregon - $1,234 but what I needed was this State Florida - $25,000, State Michigan - $31,695, State Oregon - $1,234 I was able to work around this issue by making the target field a Rich Text formatted field and then adding an HTML non-breaking space clause in the Concatenate Delimiter field, like so ,&nbsp; But that took a good bit of brain aerobics. It would be useful to be able to add a space without having to use a Rich Text field or any HTML.  Thanks for the kind words! plus one  Can you elaborate on 'then adding an HTML non-breaking space clause in the Concatenate Delimiter field' please.  See more info here  Ha. Looks like github parses out the HTML. Let me try it again ,&amp; nbsp; (without the space between the &amp; and the n) is how I set the Concatenate Delimiter to show a comma followed by a space. Remember that this requires that the target field be of type Rich Text.  Got it thanks! plus one  @friend @friend , How would you guys feel about an additional checkbox on the entry page that is named ""Add trailing space""? I think this is something we should fix as I've been asked about this exact issue when we can't make things rich text.  I was thinking of adding NBSP() in addition to BR(), handling by extending the following code.  If the target field is a rich text field the code would replace NBSP() with &amp; nbsp ; or just the space character accordingly.  I think this would work right?  I agree. That would be a simple and easy fix.  Fixed in current release.  For simple spaces use SP() ",8,0,81,0.08333333333333333,0.25,84,5,n

Could you do an  in the directory to check what are the specific permissions and owners? Maybe the find command is slightly off. And on what operating system was this executed?  @friend Ubuntu 16.04  @friend Yes I have tried that (shouldn't matter in this case anyway) and I got the same result.  Please read above where the first command works if I set the permissions to 755.  So the issue is about file permissions.  We want to understand, why this fails on your system. Do you use SELinux maybe? Because the documented permissions work fine on our systems üòï  @friend No SELinux is not installed.  Ubuntu 16.04, apache2, PHP 7.0.32 .  What should  I test?  (I can't test too much now because the server is in production now). What systems are you using?  In my case it's a Debian and an Ubuntu 16.04 and both work totally fine  @friend You did not post what command you ran for the chmod.  I showed you my file permissions were different from that after I ran the commands in the howto.  I didn't ran any command, but it has the very same permissions, as if I would ran the command. I highly doubt that the executable flag has influence if a file can be opened or not, because it is the executable flag. Also as this is more a setup issue here I will close it for now and would like to ask you to raise your question in the forums  you wish support with setup issues from Nextcloud GmbH we offer this as part of the Nextcloud subscription. Learn more about this at  @friend So you did not even try to duplicate the problem before closing the ticket?  I guess that's normal laziness from a doc team that has screenshots from five versions ago. But you didn't test so your doubt don't mean anything. Right.  Anything you can do to avoid your responsibility to have correct docs.  I see how you work. I set this up days ago and I explained how I did it.  I logged on here to help you with your documentation errors.  When you get serious about turning out responsible open source tools please contact me and I will help you debug.  It's not laziness - it's more a ""I know what this command does and it results in exactly this"". But to defend against this I executed now this command on a Ubuntu 18.04 just for you. And it turns out it still works here just fine. It does mean something if the command in question is highly unlikely responsible for the symptoms you described. That's not what we want to and we will also adjust docs, but we don't adjust docs blindly. Thanks for this, but I don't see that this is the reason and first of all we need to find the reason why it doesn't work in your case. Unfortunately the work here is done on a best effort basis. Everybody here - no matter if employed by the company or part of the community does so. The employees will obviously prioritize requests that come in from paying customers. It's also not that I didn't tried to help you, but after some steps it turned out to be something else. I hope you can understand that people like me cannot debug every single instance of every person that has a problem endlessly. At some point in time we need to say ""sorry, but that's the end of my debugging session, because neither you nor me had a useful trace of where this problem originates"". We will help you either on a best effort basis in the forums or you pay someone some money to spend a dedicated time slot together with you - that's the reality. Sorry that we can't give endless support for free here, but my day also just has 24 hours.  One last try could it be that the dot-files don't have the correct permissions? Espcially the  file? Is it writable by www-data? Because there were such reports in the forum, which where solved by this.  And another one could you run  and show the output? And then run  and show the output as well?  @friend please be a bit more respectful and understanding. I would like to remind you of our code of conduct  has explained why he didn't blindly took over your suggestions. I have tried the steps on the 4 systems I have access to as well and as far as I can tell the docs are correct.  @friend Now you're starting to make sense! I agree.  But you didn't start to debug.  You just gave up. Again I have to remind you that I already have NC working.  I am helping you to fix your docs not the other way around. I will do the debug steps when I build a test server to test new NC features.  @friend We're on GitLab not your website so your CoC does not apply.  I never was rude or violated GL's CoC.  There are people trying to work here.  Please don't waste our time.  Not really - I just have proofed that my claims (even if they were not tested) were correct. I actually worked if you wanted that from me. I still have the opinion, that this specific part with the permission is not wrong. it might be something else. Our CoC applies wherever our community interacts with each other - keep that in mind. We don't want to go that way immediately but please be respectful when demanding answers and help. As I feel highly uncomfortable with how this whole thread here went I will unsubscribe now. May somebody else help you. I will invest my time in other parts. And yes also in making the documentation better even if you think that I really don't want to do that.  @friend This does not make sense.  If you did not test then it is not proof.  It is a belief. I agree!  That is why I am helping you debug. No that is not true.  You may not choose the rules when it is not your house.  Anyway no one here was inappropriate to anyone else.  Just you didn't want to fix the docs.  @friend I actually unlocked this issue again to give you a chance to say sorry. Seems you are not sorry. Our code of conduct applies in all of our online and offline spaces. This includes all our repositories on Github amd our forum too. And your tone is not welcome in our community.

It's almost been 2 months now since the last iD release which means their imagery index is almost 2 months out of date. I'd like to see that improved, but not sure on the best path forward. @friend you said this is because ELI doesn't issue stable releases, from my understanding after each commit Travis CI will test and rebuild the index, so is  not considered the stable up to date release which iD could pull each day or so for updates?  Sometimes the build is broken - this is just a fact of development.  It happens to this index sometimes.  When it happens, Potlatch doesn't work. For iD, I'm much more comfortable depending on software that's been published by a human.  Someone should take a quick look at it and say ""ok looks good"" before incrementing the version number and typing .  That's not really asking a lot.  This index doesn't really change much. Before I publish a new version of iD, I grab the latest copy of ELI, run my script on it, and do a  to see what actually got changed. Instead - when ELI does change, semantic versioning can be used to signal to downstream projects how disruptive the change is.  A change to an imagery source in the index could be a patch release, and iD could pull these automatically.   A new property added to the schema could be a minor release.  It would be easy to handle but I'd probably want to prepare for it.   Renaming / removing a property / changing the schema would be a major release, and would break downstream projects. ELI should be allowed to do this for good reasons.   If we worked to improve the testing, do you think we could ever reach a point where it's good enough to feed straight into iD? After all each PR would go through that automated testing, plus a second pair of eyes as part of the review. Even if it broke, it wouldn't be long before someone noticed and either reverted or corrected it. Even with a release, there's always a chance bugs make it through. If we versioned ELI and effectivly did a new patch release after each PR, would that release process give any more QA over the regular PR merge process? That's a fair point, I hadn't considered schema changes. I guess for that we would need semantic versioning. Perhaps we could build this into the PR process, so that we do new patch releases for each PR which we want to go through to iD straight away?  I feel like you are not even listening to me.  This project doesn't have a version number.  It has a robot that just runs  for people who forget to do it themselves.  The robot introduces conflicts when people actually do run make. It's a ruby script that runs make in a Travis hook to smoosh together JSON files with python.  ELI might just be the hackiest nonsense I've ever seen.  This is not how reliable software is built.  ""Adding more checks"" is missing the point.  Anyone with osmlab rights could just delete all the files.  That we could ""fix it quickly"" is also missing the point.  I'm sure I'd be the person responsible for fixing it quickly. We will never take the autogenerated output on the master development branch of ELI and push it directly into iD.  Never ever.  Stop asking. Let's close this issue, so I can get on with my weekend. ",25,4,91,0.5714285714285714,0.2857142857142857,98,4,y

PROMISE ALSO WORKS WHEN USED WITHOUT AWAIT..Please Check  @friend, thanks for helping to make Electron better and especially the detailed bug report. You've made it very clear that this issue being fixed is important to you. Open source is tricky, and I understand that relying heavily on a project like Electron can be scary, frustrating, and confusing. We do not want to break anyones apps. None of the maintainers want that. We even run a program to help ensure we fix participating app's major issues during our beta cycle. However, because of the Electron maintainers' limited time and resources, we can't get to everything immediately and some things we can't get to for an extended period. This is common in open source projects. Repeatedly commenting with no new information and ""shouting"" at the development team by using all caps is not something we do here. Moving forward, I would recommend reading and following the advice in Creators, contributors, and collaborators. Just to be clear, you are welcome to continue participating in the following ways  submitting bug reports with enough detail to reproduce - ideally a Fiddle example a new feature request with context logistical questions that may not be covered in the docs (e.g. asking about release timelines in a polite way)  Including additional comments in all caps or responding repeatedly with requests of the maintainer team are off-topic and will result in those issues being closed immediately. Please follow the next step exactly Let's all take a moment to digest the above. Please do not interact with the project for 24-hours. No comments, new issues, or pull-requests. After that, please look through your open issues and edit them to ensure they're entirely on-topic, and we can continue the discussion here about the best way to engage going forward.  You don't care about issue and I wasted my time reporting this issue.I fixed it myself.Thanks for teaching me the rules and the ways not to help....Live in the rules and world of arrogance  Hi @friend , though I can understand your frustration I think you just missed a point here. You're not on a support forum and electron is an open-source project, with volunteer contributors. You cannot expect any level of support, just hope for it. It would have been nice from you to share your findings once you solved your problem, that's the way it works.  I was expecting better\polite replies.I understand its an open forum.I didn't feel like it was a conversation.I don't expect anything at all now..Cheers  @friend, we're glad to hear that you were able to find a solution to the problem you experienced. On the other hand, claiming that people don't care or that they're arrogant are specifically against the Electron Code of Conduct. Continuing with this type of behavior or further violations of the code of conduct will result in you being blocked from the Electron organization. Additionally, because we believe that further communication on this issue will only result in escalating tensions, we're going to lock the conversation. ",17,0,322,0,0,340,3,y

flood/jfurrow/240,0.046610812,jfurrow,flood,Disable authentication,7082,77,47,0.4642857142857143,3,"I know this is well rooted in your app but I would very much like to disable auth / passport and use basic auth on my reverse proxy instead. Thanks!  I'll consider making this optional in the future, but I think the vast majority of users benefit from the included authentication. Right now there are higher priority issues for me to work on, but if any of you are willing to submit a PR for optional JWT authentication, I'll gladly review it!  OP You can always use a basic auth before accessing the flood login #useless  I'm going to close this for now, but feel free to submit a PR for optional JWT auth!  I'm reopening this as it's been requested by multiple users. Let's make the authentication optional, but enabled by default.  An simple and optional config value in config.js with something like  (which defaults to true if not defined) would be very nice indeed. In my case I'm hideing most stuff behind an reverse proxy with 2FA, so additional authentication in Flood is just cumbersome smile  Might be easy to just pass plaintext credentials to the server behind the scenes if an option in the config (like mentioned above) is set, this removes any potential exploit that may arise from editing the security system to allow for sessions to be generated without proper authentication.  FWIW, the passphrase can be left blank as is.  Bonus, just pass the username then.  Hoping to help revive an older thread. While I don't know enough to help code this, I would definitely like to see this. As someone already mentioned, I have better auth already built into my nginx RP setup. I'd love to be able to remove the extra auth screen.  The simplest approach for this might be to have the config file provide some ""defaulted"" credentials and an immediate re-direct.  I think this is the better approach. Because making some default credentials and a lot of users will never change them. Make them forced to change the password bu the default account name will be the same everywhere and bad guy will have no pain to bruteforce weak password. It's maybe more work do make authentication optional but it seems more secure than providing default credentials. And this will be cleaner.  from a security standpoint would you say the flood login is tamper proof? if you cannot say ‚Äûyes‚Äú being 100% sure about it, making this optional might be a wise decision. i'll most likely audit the login part of floods code in a few days. after all i run this publically available on my homeserver with just an nginx with basic auth in front of it.  @friend No, unfortunately I cannot say with any confidence that Flood is 100% tamper proof. I'm not a security expert, so your audit would be greatly appreciated! Let's hope so! ü§û  From my POV, I don't see the interest of disabling Flood auth for enabling basic auth in most cases except for hiding the app when it is exposed on internet. To get a stronger auth system a nice idea the user can deploy, is desabling Flood auth (when it will be available) and configure Client Side Certificate Authentication.  I think It would be better to allow Flood to trust the reverse proxy in front of it (if any). We could use it for exemple if we have some kind of auth in front of it (Basic/SAML/Certificate, whatever, you name it), it would be good to be able to use it for the fearue #216  so far my audit tells me you have pretty old dependencies in use.‚ô†passportpassport-jwt` are what you use for authentication. fine by me but not up2date. feel free to test and merge this pull request  i could not upgrade from webpack 3 to 4 aswell as react 15 to 16 and d3 from 3 to 5 without actually doing big changes to the code base. but oh well.. looking good so far. hint hint node-check-updates  Note by disabling user authentication (IF you don't replace it with another authentication method like PAM for example) you will also disable multi-user capabilities. So if you have 3 users and you suddenly change the config to disable authentication, what should happen? Keep the 1st user and remove all others? No, this is nonsense. I think it should not be possible to disable authentication but only to switch to another mechanism like PAM or authentication forwarding to a reverse proxy like nginx.  I don't think that the debate should be around disabling authentication but rather for supporting Alternative authentication methods. What do you think @friend  What if you don't use the multi-user feature (they all show the same torrent list anyway). No point in password protection if the Flood instance is local only and not accessible externally.  nginx auth_request works fine btw.  just a bit hard to setup because you either have to setup a third party SSO provider, self host one or build one yourself. i kinda did the self made route now. totally better than basic auth since it does not prompt you for login if you get a 401 from flood  @friend Personally, I think all services should have authentication, even if it is only LAN? DNS rebinding could well come into this  that's why i'd recommend using nginx auth_request for all your home hosted things and do an internal redirect that's dns independent.  I think the bigger point here would be to create the option. To each his own on CHOOSING their level of security. Setting a responsible default, is on the developer to ""do security right"", but creating the options that the users are looking for, is on the developer to ""create good/flexible software"". In this case, many of us are using some other mechanism to restrict access - or some don't want auth, period. Anyone making these decisions takes the risk balance into their own hands when changing from the responsible default setting. It's sort of like saying Windows shouldn't have an option to disable a password authentication to the machine. But there are use cases that dictate or necessitate the need of such a practice. In my scenario, I'm using nginx to redirect to an auth server/service before anyone gains access to anything on the domain. So DNS rebinding is not an issue in this case, and auth is not a security issue as I've setup a different auth. For me, I'd to access this service without ANOTHER login required, even if it is typing admin with no password. The user experience is undesirable. And let's be honest, these days UX trumps all! üòÜ  @friend @friend Agreed. Does ruTorrent support multiple auth types? I've only used it with basic_auth.  I think this is no more a discussion, we more or less all agree that authentication should be enable by default and can be made optional bu user. I'm not a dev, I don't know anything about node.js, I'm only here to manage issues. Jfurrow is the main dev but he is very busy and have only a few hours a month for this project. Remember this is an open source project and that all contributions are made by member on their free time, so anyone wanting this feature can make a PR. We would proudly review and merge it.  Agreed - is there a way to just lock this thread? This way it doesn't go on, but can still be managed by the repo as a an enhancement, per the labeling?

No done, please fill Your Environment correctly. ‚ô†masterlatestN.A.`.  @friend Please also read the CODE_OF_CONDUCT and do not PM people on discord, you have the issue tracker and the discord server to do so.  @friend 1) This is not the right issue to talk about that, let's talk in #672 and #712 2) Rather than inviting people to fork ask them to join the Organization (see #672) and ask @friend to transfer this repository to the organization  I use docker, yes I build it from master everyday. Honestly my OS and version, etc don't matter as this is clearly not environment specific or version specific and I use docker.... I don't know what you are talking about with discord....I didn't message anyone. It's clear that development is all but dead and getting petty over issue templates when this is clearly an issue with enough info really puts me off. Instead of fixing things, you want to be pedantic over what are simple bugs. I'm done with this project.  @friend So you should have write docker before, this is clearly important. False, commit id is important because you can talk about something already fixed for example, and yes environment and version are important because it can change the version of dependencies, that can change the final output or break something. Still nodejs 11.x or latest is not a version, for example  is. Also npm version is different from nodejs version, npm 11 doesn't even exist, for example I have npm . Sorry for discord I thought it was you, timing coincidence  1) Yes development is quite dead because there is only 1 dev that is @friend, I'm not a dev I'm just here to help managing issues, project management and gibing security advice. 2) No, there was not enough information, as I said commit ID, node and npm version and OS are very important even if you don't understand why. Without that it is impossible to troubleshoot. 3) Yes I won't fix this because I'm not a dev. I know a little about ruby but nothing about javascript. 4) I'm not pedantic, I'm assuring there is enough information to troubleshot, because just saying ""It won't work"" or just pasting a screenshot is clearly not enough to do anything. 5) I'm sorry but I'm spending my free time here just to help and you are very aggressive with me. Also this is a free, libre and open-source project, not a proprietary and paid product where you bought some support or anything. There is no warranty. If you think that development is to slow, please learn the JavaScript language and come help @friend. 6) About the template being to heavy that's why we slit issues by category. Here, we know now this is not a bug, so you should have open a Feature Request issue with a much lighter template. I'm sorry I'll lock this conversation as this is just you being aggressive and not constructive and violating the code of conduct. ",10,9,158,0.3125,0.125,92,4,y

Having looked at the hint structure, I think we should make some changes.  The hint currently accepts only plain-text whereas most of the MDN resources are links. The hint generates a toast to which we could add an action link, but I wonder if using a dropdown on the hint button might not be a better approach. Alternatively, if we could limit the number of hints on each exercise to 1 hint, we could do away with the toast and have a one-click hint button to open the resource in a new tab.  Thought on any of this?  @friend Good suggestions üëç I'm not really sure what the hints are supposed to be like. I believe the idea is that they should be like the hints on the forum. Should we close this in favour of  Whoa. Hadn't seen that issue. Thanks @friend.

Couple a question to make sure we fully understand your issue  By ""can't activate"", which one do you mean  The setting is not saved You get an error while trying to create/edit a VM config with 3D acceleration You cannot start a VM which has 3D acceleration enabled   And by ""I can do it on VirtualBox"", which do you mean  Using the GUI, I can start the exact same machine with the same configuration Using the GUI, I can start another machine with the same configuration Using VBoxManage, I can start the same machine with the same configuration in GUI mode Using VBoxManage, I can start another machine with the same configuration in GUI mode Using VBoxManage, I can start the same machine with the same configuration in Headless mode Using VBoxManage, I can start another machine with the same configuration in Headless mode     Yeah sorry I should have been more careful in my post but i was a bit in a rush. So sorry about that. so when I try to activate the settings and then save the configuration of the VM it tells me failed. If I try to create a virtual machine in virtualbox with the GUI, it accept the settings without complaining. I don't have tested yet with VBoxManage but I can try tomorrow if you want. And if you  do a little google search you will see that virtualbox should accept intel graphic chipset and if it does not it is considered as a bug. execpt on mint which is not compatible apparently. Maybe other systems too? anyway my host is a ubuntu 16.04.1 server with xfce4 interface on it. I wanted to activate on windows guest as win7 . but with other guests it doesn't seem to activate itself either.  I can try to diagnose further if you want tomorrow. but if you have some leads, I'm all ears open.  After saving the configuration, you should have a related task in the hyperbox client window at the bottom. Can you double click on that task and let me know the exact error message displayed there? it's the last text field in the window.  I don't have much time to test it right now and it won't be very useful because the disk of the vm is not in a great format for windows (.QED here in place of VMDK) .... shit apprently it doesn't do it anymore at the saving of the VM now it does it at the start of the VM but that s more of a VBoxManage message I guess so I will do more testing tomorrow if you don't mind to see if virtualbox accept the configuration and if hyperbox return an error.  I will post here tomorrow. sorry to disturb you about that )  ""This VM was configured to use 3D acceleration. However, the 3D support of the host is not working properly and the VM cannot be started. To fix this problem, either fix the host 3D support (update the host graphics driver?) or disable 3D acceleration in the VM settings (VERR_NOT_AVAILABLE)""  You're not disturbing anything, thank you for taking the time to report this issue! No rush to give the extra info, whenever is best for you.  So I'm just working with my test right now. I've just create a vm with virtualbox GUI with 3D acceleration, right now I'm just installing windows right now. But anyway if the 3D acceleration wasn't working, it wouldn't start it at all since I think the verification of the possibility of 3D acceleration is made before launching the VM right?  well I don't really know how to test it inside a vm but anyway i've installed a windows 7vm and the 3D acceleration tells me its activated while I run the vm ... so should I try to create same vm with vboxmanage?  After checking with the VirtualBox devs, 3D Acceleration would only be supported in a proper GUI user session. Trying to start a VM with 3D Acceleration enabled through a software like Hyperbox which runs as a service without any UI/X server configuration will cause the VM to fail. They don't plan to support it either, so that's it in term of ""official"" answer. On the unofficial side, if you run Hyperbox under Linux, you can always include a DISPLAY env variable in the init.d script and point to a properly configure X Server and see if that works.  mmmmh okey now I understand, it has to have a display ok ... understood thanks nayway ",27,0,117,0,0,181,6,n

i2cdevlib/jrowberg/252,0.14744432,jrowberg,i2cdevlib,Serious bug at Jeff Rowberg library with MPU6050 at Arduino,49814,575,262,0.36923076923076925,11,"Sometimes my Arduino freezes or crashes when using JEFF ROWBERG library to read DMP data from MPU6050. It took me almost a full year to discover the problem and today I had some spare time and I tried to find where exactly arduino hangs/freezes. I discovered it is usually when executin getFIFOCount() or getIntStatus(). I discovered that inserting many Serial.print with tags along my entire code so I could know exactly which line hanged. So I discovered everytime my arduino hanged/freezes it was at a line with getFIFOCount() or getIntStatus(). So I decided to take a close look at it. Inside the file MPU6050.cpp there is a code like this uint16_t MPU6050getFIFOCount() {     I2CdevreadBytes(devAddr, MPU6050_RA_FIFO_COUNTH, 2, buffer);     return (((uint16_t)buffer[0]) &lt;&lt; 8) | buffer[1]; } I checked the function ""readBytes()"" inside I2Cdev.cpp and I found this I2CdevreadBytes(uint8_t devAddr, uint8_t regAddr, uint8_t length, uint8_t *data, uint16_t timeout) You see the problem? The function readBytes accepts one last parameter which is ""timeout"" but the function getFIFOCount uses readBytes without the timeout parameter! That's probably a bug cause sometimes I think the readBytes takes too long to execute and a TIMEOUT SHOULD BE set to avoid the function hanging out forever. I am pretty sure maaaany MAAAANY other people alterady experienced this problem and spent a lot of time trying to understand what went wrong. Some people mistakenly believe it's related to bufffer overflow in the FIFO or because of some non optimized code. It could be the problem but MY PROBLEM FOR ALMOST A FULL YEAR has been this bug reported here. I really hope someone fix this and add a timeout so nobody would spent entire months anymore seeking a problem that's is really hard to track an intermitent.  This is my first time using the library and I think I am running into this issue as well. Did you figure out what timeout to give? Thank You.  No, it looks like this library support is dead. I think we should move to other alternatives cause this library has already many bugs documented and unresolved so it's really unreliable if you are gonna use this library to anything serious. Jeff Rowberg is not providing the good support he gave to this library in the old days so I think you would be better off this library  Apologies for the lack of support. I've tried to migrate most of the effort to online forums and other willing (and often more capable) contributors as much as possible, since I can't devote the time to this that I used to. The best laid plans of mice and men, as it were... However, in this case, I strongly doubt that it is the lack of a timeout argument that is causing the underlying issue. Arduino's Wire library does not actually provide timeout functionality. If you dig into the code, you'll see a blocking loop in the TWI calls. See this for example  a timeout in I2Cdevlib code would make zero difference, because there's no way to pass it to the underlying Wire/TWI implementation. The only way around this is to use a different timeout-capable I2C implementation. This is possible, but not simple. I would recommend checking the SDA/SCL lines with a logic analyzer to see when/why the sensor stops responding. The blocking loop inside Arduino's Wire/TWI code should not hang as long as the sensor responds according to the I2C spec.  @friend I never wanted to offend you. I know you did this library for free and you are contributing a lot with the community providing it to general use. This library is really great but there are some bugs with it. When you have sometime I would like you to take a look at this  some reason your library is a little ""unstable"", when you change some lines of code it simply stops working. I also provide you below with a really simple code to use your great library to retrive DMP data from MPU6050 without using interrupt pin. It simply freezes arduino after some time. I already checked with an osciloscope and everything is working fine there is not reason (at the hardware) that could make this freeze happens. Could you please run the code below in your arduino and wait a few seconds? After around 10-30 seconds your arduino will freeze.  Hello, I used to have the same problems. Try running it without the serial prints.It had worked for me. cheers and regards On Tue, Jun 28, 2016 at 951 PM, batata004 notifications@friend.com wrote  I tried it right now and didnt work ( I even tried changing the baud rate and it also didnt work. I think it's not related to Serial but to something in the library cause there is never a buffer overflow when I run the above code in my arduino so the Serial is not causing a significant delay that could cause a problem/overflow. I am pretty sure is something related to MPU6050 DMP library.  @friend please, when you have a time try the code I gave you in your arduino with MPU6050. I am sure it's gonna freeze and I would like to know from you where is the bug of the library so I can fix it on my end.  I changed, too. Yes ,it still happens.I am waiting Rowberg to explain it.  yeap, same here. I really hope Rowberg replies us here.  Do you use mag?„ÄÄI use the HMC5883L with mpu6050 to read the mag raw data and read the pitch yaw roll by DMP is fine. But when I use the mpu9150 to read the the mag data by DMP only , it keeps overflow and  freezes soon. You should change your TWBR =24 to =12 or substitute TWBR to Wire.setclock(400000),if only read data without mag ,mine is working fine with this edition by Jeff Rowberg.  I only use MPU6050 without any magnetometer, and I try to read data from DMP (not raw data). It freezes after a while. You think chaing TWBR from 24 to 12 should help?  Yes, or Wire.setclock(400000).  I tried it just right now. If freezed using ""Wire.setClock(400000);"" and also when using ""TWBR = 12;"". Any suggestion?  A while ago I had issues with FIFO overruns on a 9150 but I can't remember the details. Switching to FastWire fixed it for me.

Any suggestion? ‚Äî You are receiving this because you are subscribed to this thread. Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub or mute the thread Sir, how I switch to fast wire?  This is not a bug - your loop is taking too long, and the buffer in the IMU is filling up and crashing the I2C bus/processor. That's why removing Serial prints and reducing delays (as you mention in your Arduino forum posts) solves the problem. That's why switching the code to check the FIFO will work. It manifests in many ways. Jeff has written repeatedly in his documentation to check the buffer as often as possible - adding a delay(100) is the opposite of that. In my experience, you need to check the buffer at least every 12ms to long term stability, but the faster the better. You should close this bug report.  @friend you certainly have no idea what you are talking about and you surely should delete your reply to this bug report. Read all the thread, I am not using any delay and I know much better than you how important it is to keep the loop fast.  Wow. You're really just an angry brat, aren't you? No wonder no one is trying to help you. You're wrong, but I'm not going to show you why.

Please excuse any impoliteness; it is not intended.  @friend , any progress on this matter?  I gave up, this library is too buggy in many aspects and Jeff Rowberg does not care about solving these MANY bugs that you can find with a simple search at Google. Also Jeff does not even read these threads. IMPORTANT DONT USE JEFF'S LIBRARY FOR ANYTHING IMPORTANT. Sooner or later it will fail and if you are using this library with your quadcopter, robotic arm... STAY AWAY OF IT. You will get hurt and hurt other people. There are serious problems with this library which will, sooner or later, cause you intermitent problems.  @friend, please try to avoid sensationalist language with unsubstantiated claims. Yes, I am reasonably certain that the I2Cdev core and especially some of the device libraries are not bug-free. However, they have worked remarkably well with very few changes for literally thousands of people, some of whom have come back to tell me so after the fact (with complete, stable, working project demos). As noted in my comment from June 28, I2Cdev core code itself does not contain any loops that could lock up the whole system. The Wire library, however, does. This is well-documented and tracked separately. It is not something that I2Cdevlib code can fix, other than switching to a different I2C implementation (which is not a bad idea, but it is outside the scope of this bug report). I still contend that I2Cdev core communication works correctly as long as the hardware is electrically reliable. If the hardware is not electrically reliable, the CPU freeze is because of the Wire library, which has a blocking  loop and no timeout as documented in Arduino issue #1476. I have taken the example code that you posted on June 28 and run it with no modifications in the following setup  Arduino IDE v1.6.11 I2Cdevlib repo pulled from latest Github master branch Official Arduino Uno R3 GY521 breakout board for MPU-6050 AD0 pin tied to Arduino GND VCC pin to Arduino 5V (GY-521 has 3.3v regulator on board) SDA/SCL pins connected to Arduino SDA/SCL correctly Saleae Logic analyzer monitoring SDA and SCL   Your sketch compiles and flashes correctly. The DMP initialization completes without issue, and the YPR output settles within a few seconds to a stable value. I have left it running for 15 minutes with no problems. It has remained totally stable with no freezes, FIFO overflows, or other problems. To test, I pulled out the SCL wire to simulate an electrical issue. This (at least this time) caused the SDA line to get stuck low  The I2Cdev core is not doing this inside its own abstraction code. The GY-521 has 2.2k pull-up resistors on the SDA/SCL lines, so something is driving SDA low during a read operation from the Arduino side. Reconnecting the SCL wire does not resume normal operation, even with all zero data coming back. This suggests that the Wire library got stuck in its blocking  loop while the MPU-6050 sensor is holding SDA low waiting for more clock pulses, which won't come because the Wire library is stuck. (Maybe. I haven't dug into the Wire library's guts.) But the main point here is that it worked perfectly until I broke the hardware on purpose. I will reset the Arduino and let it run for another long while just to confirm this (expected) behavior.  Thanks jeff and I didnt want to offend you. No. I appreciate your help, but I think it would be smart to let people know that your library sometimes crashes. Yes, I executed this same code many times with no problem. But sometimes when I just add some lines of code it gets completely unstable, and after a while it does not generate any other problem. Jeff, I dont have bad wiring, this is not my case. The wires are very well connected to arduino.  I realized this bug happens when you call mpu.getFIFOCount() too many times in small time frame. It almost always freezes at mpu.getFIFOCount() (right when it gets executed). I know that for a fact cause I puted serial.println before and after that function, and it freezes the only the first serial.println. You library may work fine in a moment, in another it just does not work. Adding some lines make the code break sometimes, and other times dont (there is no conflict between your code and those new lines). Jeff, I appreciate your attention and efforts into this library but something is not right. Maybe you are right and it's bad wiring, but in my case it surelly is not. I tested this setup in other arduinos and got similar results. I dont know if you ever heard of SEBRAE here in Brazil. It's an education institution ""for free"", with small fees. I know at least 2 good friends which are teachers of this institution in electronics and also confirmed the problem I was facing. It was them who made me come here and report this. I tried to report this problem in many different foruns and in almost all cases, in the middle of the thread, other people confirmed what I said and had the same problem with different setups. If you think this problem happens of because of some lines of I2C getting LOW, why cant you setup and interrupt in your code to check if the line is LOW for too long and maybe reset the device it that timeout happens? I never used an original arduino, I always used clones, maybe some poor build in those clones cause this problem? Sorry if I disrespected you, you are a nice guy who devoted lots of time to this library however I think, IMHO, that it's not safe using your library in quadcopters, robotic arms... someone could get seriously hurt.  @friend I don't think you are quite getting the point Jeff is making. The problem is not with his library, but with the Arduino Wire library itself that is part of the Arduino IDE. More specifically it is the two-wire interface (TWI) library that the Wire library calls to handle I2C communications. I stumbled upon this discussion looking for an alternative implementation of an I2C library for a unrelated device I am using and can confirm that any device that calls the Wire library will suffer the same issue you are talking about. While loops are used in the TWI library for communication, and as a result, the code can block all other functions on the Arduino while it is waiting infinitely in the TWI while loop. Jeff demonstrated the infinite loop by pulling out the SCL wire from his hardware. Internally, the TWI library provided by Arduino waits for a response from the sensor that is never coming because the physical wire is removed. While your friends at SEBRAE confirmed the behavior, like you they have wrongly assumed it is due to Jeff's code. If you took a different I2C sensor with a library written by a different person (such as the one for the sensor I am using) and pulled a wire, it would behave the exact same way. As for why can't Jeff put an interrupt in his code to check if the line is LOW for too long, the library is blocking anything from happening (Which is why everything stops). The Arduino environment is not a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). The issue is outside Jeff's code. I hope this clarifies the issue.  @friend you made it very clear, but it still does not explain why reading data from BMP180 using any library around will never hang, never. But as soon as I disconnect BMP180 and connect MPU6050 problems start to happen. It may be a problem in the WIRE implementation, ok! Maybe for some reason MPU6050 has some problem (I already tried at least 5 different modules from 3 different sellers in the last year or so) with the hardware, I dont know. I can only say that this problem only happens with me 1) WHEN using MPU6050 with jeff's library 2) WEN I try to read veery fast data from MPU6050, if I read data once every 100ms, it all works fine 3) in unprecitable times, I cant be sure that it will happen now, but it will certainly happen at some moment Anyway, you were all very clear and made a point. Maybe it's wire.h implementation that is faulty!  @friend Thanks for your response. I hope that no offence was taken. The issue I am having is actually related to the BME280, a distant relative of the BMP180 sensor, and communications via TCP/IP. My hardware and project is quite different from what you are discussing, and I do not use the MPU6050. From my quick Google search it sounds like the sensor does a lot, and making it work with other I2C hardware is tricky. I wanted to offer some feedback only because I noticed the strong language in your reply to Jeff. I did a quick test with my project, in which the BME280 is the only device communicating via I2C. My microprocessor is an ESP8266 (Which is quite a bit faster than the Uno) and I am using a common industrial protocol over TCP/IP. I have some software that is polling the ESP8266 every second, and I am actively debugging using the serial interface, so there is additional work being done by the system. I pulled one of the wires, and the system kept working. I put the wire back, still no problems. I tried this a couple more times, randomly, and finally the system stopped working. I am only asking for one value via I2C and one value over the industrial communication channel, so I would guess that if I increased the amount of data through the different interfaces, the problem might start to happen more often. Anyways, I hope that you can find a solution to the problem you are having. I thought I would share what I have experienced. Take care!  @friend  no offence taken ) Glad to know your case, indeed it looks even more a problem with I2C protocol itself than with the jeff's library. What you said is exactly what happens to me, randomly/intermitently problems (as you removed the wired a few times). Anyway, I hope jeff or somebody here with great knowledge in this subject could file a feature request/bug report at Arduino community so they can bring some light to this and solve this problem.  @friend  Hey did you find the solution to the problem ?  I am also facing the same issue, sometimes the library gets stuck at fifo count function .  @friend It's really sad but I got no solution for this problem. It already consumed hundreds of hours trying to work around this but sometimes I think I2C is the guilty but other times I thinks it's jeff's library the problem. It's really an intermitent problem and it's hard to make other people believe I am not doing something stupid - which I am not doing. I wish Jeff could take a look at this serious problem cause many many many other people are facing it on other forum posts and so far no solution.  I have looked into the issue both with and without your supplied code, but have not been able to replicate it without intentionally severing the hardware I2C connection. Any additional troubleshooting will require a logic capture with a Saleae analyzer or similar during a moment when the problem actually occurs on your own platform. But even with this additional detail, I expect the root cause to be outside of any of the I2Cdev code.  @friend  thanks for helping. I dont have a logic analyzer, hope another person with this same problem that owns a logic analyzer can provide details about this problem.  batata004  If you have a jtag emulator. It is the best way of finding issue. Since you are detecting the issue, it is best for you to debug it. ‚Ä¢   Just stop the processor at the failure point and see what is wrong. ‚Ä¢   Learn from each break point and set more break point to track the problem back to find the root cause. Regards, Pirooz  @friend I never hard of ""jtag emulator"", sorry I dont have access to one, I will ask a good friend of mine tomorrow to know if he has one and can borrow me for a day.  I helped someone fix the issue with the same setup using the Arduino 101 libraries and fixed the performance issue in the same area that you are having problem. Someone added a fixed delay after wire operation in the readbyte call that was slowing down the I2C accesses. Just remember if you use too many print statement in this area would create new issue or make the issue worse. If you print something, maybe you should print one character and only use one debug statement at a time until you get Jtag emulator. Also remember you have multiple FIFO in the pipe and it may be getting confused dealing with its threshold setting. I2C controller FIFO, Accelerometer FIFO. Do both generate interrupt? If so disable one and use different method of hand shaking.  @friend actually what you are saying is very true! If I dont call too frequently FIFO functions (or retrieve data) this problem does not happen, so your solution to add a delay will certainly help IF, AND ONLY IF, this delay is not too high which could cause the fifo overflow. This ""bug"" relies in the fact that if you request data too fast using I2C something will get wrong at some time and will freeze arduino. And what is really really strange is that sometimes when arduino freezes the watchdog fires, and sometimes not. I use watchdog to turn off my quad if arduino is not working for 500ms but sometimes arduino freezes and watchdog does not even fire.  @friend May be I did not say it correctly. The driver had not needed delay and I removed it to fix the issue. If you have extra delay in the driver, when you call it then you have to wait the same amount of time or more otherwise thing get backed up and creates problem.  It helps if you check status of thing before you write or read so no conflict will happen.  @friend I have similar problems on Arduino nano. Arduino freeze after variable time and it depends on inv_set_fifo_rate.  It run cca 20 minutes when I set 0x04, but it is too slow for me. After reading this thread I started experimenting with TWBR. I use your sketch and now I have 100Hz fifo rate and TWBR 103, sketch is running more than 1 hour without problem. I don't know why, but may be it helps you.  Hi all, Well... I use Jeff's library together with the NRF24L01 Radio 2.4GHz transceiver library on an Arduino UNO. The idea is to read data from the MPU6050 and then transmit it for further processing by a nearby computer. My problem with that was that I would, like most of you, see the arduino freeze after some seconds. The chances of getting the problem was somehow correlated with the use of the serial print, but not just that in my case! I work on an university robotic lab, thus I have permission to use multiples arduino boards. One day, trying to debug the problem, I noticed that the code would run normally on some arduino board (not freeze) and not in others. I had those made in Italy and those made in China.. It turns out, only the Italian ones work.  If I upload the same code on the Chinese boards it doesn't work! So, I assume, there must be some hardware incompatibilities issues with the library. In summary, I removed all calls to serial print inside the arduino loop function and use only Italian made boards. In the receiver code (arduino connected to the computer), I use the jeff's library with ros, in order to read the transmitted data from the serial port. It works for me! The only thing now is that I want to receive data at 100Hz, now I receive at about 48Hz. Maybe, the @friend tip on playing with TWBR may also work. Let's see!  Hi @friend I need to get the raw values from the accelerometer normalized  - in the range [0,1], can you please give me some ideas on how to proceed? I saw you post here about the raw values received from the module. Since I am using the default setting in the I2Cdevlib class, would it be correct to just divide the accelerometer x, y, z values by 32767? I appreciate your answer, thanks.  Hi, Indeed my boards are chinese or clone ones, I never had the chance to test this problem in a original board. It would be nice if someone could find a chinese board to Jeff so he could test this bug and maybe fix it. @friend  if you want to ""normalize"" a value what you need to do is simple, is map function from arduino, see here  Something like this float x = map(PLACE_YOUR_ACCEL_DATA_HERE,-32768,32768,0,1); Hope it helps.  Change TWBR on 103 realy help me, but it's not perfect. Now it's running few hours, but still freeze at the end. It's much better then few minutes or seconds. It all depend on amount of code and amount printed chars between fifo readings and on fifo rate. I have chinese clone too. I spent long time on searching for right value for TWBR. Results of different values are very variable from seconds to minutes. TWBR 103 runs in hours for me, you need another value, may be, you must try. I use 6050 2 years at chinese clones only and all that time I tried find the solution for this problem without succes. I will try buy italien version and test it, but better is find problem with chinese clones. Mr. Rowberg I buy one for you. I don't have skills to debug I2C lib.  Indeed @friend I already palyed with TWBR and it produces some different timings on the freeze, low values freezes faster. When I get home I will try 103 but the most time I could run the code without freezing is a few minutes, never got a full hour. Maybe your arduino clone is better than  the ones they sell here in brazil (also from china).  @friend I know how things are in Brazil regarding this. Boa sorte!  @friend, can you provide a link to an online store/auction (eBay, Aliexpress, etc.) for the same kind of clone that you have?  @friend OBRIGADO! ) @friend the clone that I bought is from this seller  this  never bought it from eBay or Aliexpress.  @ ewerlopes Keep in mind the FCC and Europe regulatory body require different power and transmission duty cycle that may be helping to show the issue more. Looks like we have throughput issue with something getting behind and overflowing a buffer or memory. If you use Jtag emulator. You can stop the MCU at freeze point and see where we are. Then you can breakpoint at the start of that routine and see how you are getting there. The best tools for debugging this type of issue.  This looks like the same thing  enough for testing?  that looks really close, the only difference is that for some reason my arduino's driver is ch340 and this one looks like ch340g, I dont know if this makes any difference.  Actually this one looks more close to mine -&gt;  cheaper the better cause here in brazil they only sell garbage, so you should probably try to find the shittiest/cheapest arduino and try it out.  I've ordered one of both. The one from China will take a lot longer to get here.  Nice! I really hope you get a faulty one and you can check this problem so the community can benefit from your learnings ) Thanks man, I had already given up using your library, now I have high hopes I can come back to use it!  I bought original Arduino nano on friday. Same code run till discharge of battery (cca 6hrs) on 100Hz.  @friend you are right. Thank you;) Mr. Rowberg thank's for your patience. I hope you find solution of clone troubles. And thank's for your libraries.  @friend I am happy to see that the problem is somehow solved! By the way, I tried to modify the TWBR  value but it did not work. I keep receiving data at about 48Hz. However, this sample frequency is not a huge problem to me now. Good luck!  @friend  TWBR is I2C rate, look here  . If you want change dmp rate, you must change it in library.  Search for this part in 6Axis_Motion and change AxAA to desired value.  It's near line number 300. ‚ô†0x02,   0x16,   0x02,   0x00, AxAA                // D_0_22 inv_set_fifo_rate 0x03 - posledni // This very last 0x01 WAS a 0x09, which drops the FIFO rate down to 20 Hz. 0x07 is 25 Hz, // 0x01 is 100Hz. Going faster than 100Hz (0x00=200Hz) tends to result in very noisy data. // DMP output frequency is calculated easily using this equation (200Hz / (1 + value))`  I tried 200Hz (0x00) and it's run 200Hz and it's independent on TWBR. I change TWBR for better stability of chinese clone only, not for change of DMP speed.  Sorry to be late to the party. I had struggled with what I believe was the same problem; the program would run and then randomly lock up. I have to echo what slesta came up with. In the file ""MPU_6050_6Axis_MotionApps20.h"" down at line 266.  I changed the 0x01 which is 100HZ to 0x02 which is about 66HZ and I get a pretty reliable readout. I have yet to test it on a mobile platform, but it is pretty funny to have it in the car with me and watch it give me yaw information when I turn.  My set up is an Ardunino Nano V3.1 with a Level Translator Breakout - PCA9306 to interface with the MPU.  Yaw drifts about 1 degree every minute and a half or so but for my application this should work. Hope this helps.  @friend to me it does not matter the rate I read the buffer, eventually it will freeze. Could you please confirm that you arduino is original or a clone? You yaw drift I think is expected, you could use a magnetometer to fix that, nothing too complicated.  Hi everyone, is there any progress on this task? I am using the library as well and not only with UNO but also with DUE; which has a more powerful ARM based microcontroller and although everything is fine with the raw values, it crashes after a while of usage in the DMP6 version. What ever TWBR or FIFO rate I tried did not matter, waiting approx 2 min (max) results crash.  Hello people! I stumbled upon this topic while searching for info about MPU6050 latching SDA down. For the record -- I'm having the same latching problem with i.MX6 SoC running Linux. Incidentally, it also always happens getting the FIFO count, as far as I've tested at the moment (but not always on the same byte). Anyway, the reason I'm posting this, is -- given the number of hits in Google -- I have good enough reason to believe this bug is due to MPU6050 chip itself. The variance of when it crashes is highly variable though.  @friend  would you mind telling where did you by you MPU6050? Mine I bought from a good reputation store that is a college for studants learning arduino. I think you are correct, there is some sort of problem with the chip itself that causes this problem BUT the Wire library should be able to handle this right, I think the problem is with WIRE and MPU6050 library, none of them are knowing how to handle some unexpected behaviour (or now ""expected behaviour"" as many reported it) with the chip. Sometimes one of the communication lines dont go back to HIGH or something like that... JEFF'S library and WIRE.H library should know bettter how to handle intermitent connection problems, maybe using timeouts.  @friend Not at all. I bought two units from Drotek -- both exhibit the same behaviour... much to my dismay. No, not really. MPU6050 latching SDA low is a violation of I¬≤C protocol. Thus, this means undefined behaviour for the library. It really is up to you -- as system engineer -- to handle such situations. There is no universal way to unlatch such a chip although a common technique is disabling I¬≤C, sending 9 clock cycles over SCL pin (as a GPIO) and reenabling I¬≤C mode if SDA unlatches. (Or resetting the offending chip, if possible.) Regarding, the situation with Wire -- it would certainly be nice if it could detect a SDA latch condition as it currently just freezes preventing further handling. This is in fact an oft requested feature. Of course, this requires use of a Timer which is a precious resource on an Arduino. Either way, in my humble opinion, the only correct way for Wire to go about it -- if it were to implement timeouts -- return an error, and let the designer handle it. @friend may (or may not) then choose to implement quirky chip handling, but currently his hand are tied. One last note -- please understand that this is not a bug, you've filed a feature request. I also encourage you to try patching the code yourself and share your results (should you choose to). This is an open-source community. Weee! smiley  @friend I agree with everything you said ) Only one single thing that I not agree it's of course the programmer/engineer responsable for mantaining and keep its code base working. BUT there is a big BUT here arduino freezes when this problem that I reported here happens. How can I try to fix this problem if arduino freezes? The only possible to me try to fix this would be to change the implementatino of Jeff's code and Wire.h. You can imagine that I am not too inside those 2 libraryes, I am not developing a veeery simple head tracking mechanism while I would also have to deeply study WIRE.H and Jeff's library. I think it's in the community's interest that those people able to do that, if they feel happy about that, that they should help. It's not a reasonable argument that I should try to fix the problem, if the owner of the library is having a difficult time trying to solve this problem, who am I to try to solve it? I know this is how open source works, and I love everything about it. But, IMHO, this is indeed a bug. If the library is told to do something AND it does not, it's a bug. You a library gets responsable to provide you ACCEL/GYRO data and it freezes once in a while, it's not a feature request that this freeze stops happening, it's a bug. Nobody comes to a bugtracker and says ""Please, I love your library but sometimes it freezes, would you mind adding a feature request that, if possible, can you please, please, LITTLE PLEASE, stop your library's code from freezing and crashing?"". As I see it's a bug, plain and simple bug. But I am happy we disagree on that, otherwise this community would never get so big and raise so many important discussions if everybody had the same ideas! \o/  I have similar situation. My current setup includes a generic MPU6050 (probably a GY-521) and a Dual h-bridge motor driver board and Arduino Pro mini running at 5volts/16mhz. I am using Jeff's library and it works well without the motors running. I am using DMP to get the values from the Gyro. However problems seemed to come when the motors already turned on. At first I tried to eliminate the problem's cause. My first guess is that it's due to the motor's noise that's causing the MPUs erratic behavior or freeze. When running the MPU with the Motors turned on, the longest I can get is about 15 seconds and it seems I am blocked somewhere in an infinite loop. The motors are still running but I could not make it react using the IR sensors and if I pull off the MPU during the run, the functionality of my motors' feedback system resumes.  So I suspect that it's the motor driver that's causing the erratic behavior of the MPU. But here's the interesting thing, when I used the code from here  using Jeff's library), in fact it's also using the Wire.h. I integrated my motor functionalities into the new sketch to see if both MPU and the motor runs, then I was able to make it work it runs indefinitely without MPU readouts freezing. In conclusion to this finding, it's Jeff's library that's causing the problem.  @friend really interesting result and it matches what I initially thought jeff's library has a problem. I was induced to believe it was wire.h library fault but that cant be possible cause when I extract data direct from the sensor using only wire.h my arduino never freezes. it only freezes when I use jeff's library to get dmp data (that I cant get using only wire.h). Hope jeff investigate this better.  This is a good data point, but it does not conclusively indicate a problem in I2Cdevlib code. The code from arduino.cc example, for instance, does not use the DMP, so the MPU itself is operating mode without making use of its internal processor. Since this issue has focused on failure case when the DMP is active, that's a significant difference. All comments on this issue referring to raw data access only (no DMP) indicate that the I2Cdevlib code is rock solid. Unless the freezing problem also happens when using I2Cdevlib code for only raw accel/gyro readings, @friend's case does not actually add new information to what we have already seen. Also, the I2Cdevlib code adds some (very) small processing overhead to each I2C transaction since it is another layer of function call abstraction around the core TWI hardware. Given the seemingly random nature of the freeze failures, it is possible that unpredictable small timing differences have an effect on whether the failure case occurs. If this is happening, it still does not necessarily mean that I2Cdevlib code has a defect, but only that I2Cdevlib code increases the probability of conditions necessary for the problem to occur. To get back to the fundamental point here  MPU6050 latching SDA low is a violation of I¬≤C protocol, as @friend pointed out. The Wire library has an internal blocking infinite while loop with no timeout/cancel mechanism. I2Cdevlib code has no blocking infinite while loops itself, and cannot break out of the one in the Wire library..  In other words  The MPU6050 is doing something it shouldn't, and The Wire library does not accommodate this behavior cleanly, and I2Cdevlib cannot fix this without requiring a dedicated hardware timer or else rewriting or replacing the Wire library itself, which is technically possible but outside the current scope of the project and would necessarily compatibility with current and previous Arduino installations.  I am all for clean, bug-free code, but I have yet to identify any potential root cause(s) for this behavior in I2Cdevlib. The true root cause appears to be in the MPU itself, or might be worked around (or at least detected) with a Wire library improvement or kludge like testing  inside the while loop. Detecting and mitigating the problem at the I2Cdevlib layer while still using the Wire library as-is would require a prohibitively complex and resource-intensive addition of timers and interrupts. This type of fix would be more suitably (and just as easily) added to the main application logic rather than the I2Cdevlib code, since 99% of the time it would be irrelevant for other I2Cdevlib users.  @friend you are always very clear and informative. All your conclusions and assumptions are correct (IMHO) but would you mind explaning why when I grab data from the MPU6050 (raw) it never freezes and when I grab using MPU6050 intermitently is freezes? For example, the code below works PERFECTLY. Never freezes, is super reliable and I never never never had any problem when using it. If there was any problem with MPU6050's processor or some timing issue, it would create some intermitent problem when also using the code above. On the other hand, as soon as I use your demo code (the one that extracts data from MPU6050) problems start to happen. I never used your getMotion6 code to check if the problem also happens cause if I have to extract raw data I prefer doing so with the minimum of abstraction as possible, using the pure Wire.h library and notihng else. I really think jeff you could get some cheap MPU6050 from china (clone ones) with also an arduino (my is nano clone) and simulate the problem. I think that if you could see the problem by yourself you would be as frustrated as any other person that finds this problem. I also have to say that MOST people that play around with arudino (I think that most of the people really) are totally beginners and enthusiatics. They will not report any bug or problem, they will think they are doing sometihng stupid and will give up. So I am pretty sure this problem is under reported because people have no idea wha they did wrong AND EVEN IF THEY DIDNT DO ANYTHING WRONG people will always tell those beginners that they are inserting code that takes too long to execute (like delay) and that's the person's fault.  HI @friend, This is exactly the problem that nobody can explain (so far). I don't think this is true. The issue seems to concern the MPU's behavior when the DMP is in use. By all accounts, the fact that it works perfectly when you use native Wire API calls to get raw data but it randomly freezes when using I2Cdevlib code to use the DMP is not because you're using I2Cdevlib code in the failing case, but rather because you are using the DMP in the failing case. I fully expect that if you did test the getMotion6 example with your hardware, it would work fine. Likewise, if you mimic the DMP initialization routine yourself using Wire and not I2Cdevlib, and then read DMP packets from the FIFO also using Wire and not I2Cdevlib, I expect your hardware will fail the same as it is doing now. It may be worth rolling my own I2C/TWI implementation with timeout support, or switching the underlying implementation to something like NBWire. However, I'm not sure it is worth spending a lot of time specifically troubleshooting a case that only appears to occur with clone Arduino or especially clone MPU parts. If the problem originates inside the MPU, then there is no guarantee that we could fix it even if we could detect it and avoid a blocking case. That would, at least, allow triggering an MPU reset instead of just freezing the entire CPU though.  @friend thanks man! Indeed, when DMP is active maybe something weird happens with the module. Maybe it's enabling the DMP that causes the problem in the module. I just dont agree with your argument that this problem ""only"" appears with clones. Recpectfully, I assure you that here in Brazil 90% of people buy clones as for arduino as for mpu6050. Maybe in your country people can afford original ones but here I am pretty sure no more than 10% of people use original/certified hardware. Anyway, I think if more people had time to investigate why their arduinos freezes more people would join me complaining about this problem. And maybe you would be convinced the amount of people that is having to deal with this. I dont know much about how your library works (nor wire.h) but I think using some type of timeout would fix the problem easily. If the DMP does not respond for (example) 100ms, you output some message and keep the user code running. Or maybe you could reset the module and initialize it again if the response is taking too long. I have no idea if this is easy or hard, but if someday you find some spare time I am pretty sure this implementation would save loooots of time of many people! Despite what I said I respect you and you already did an AMAZING library for all the community! I with there were more people that know deep about this and would be willing to help you!  It's a pity. The library looks really nice, but I can't use it when it's crashing. The combination of hardware I'm using is the GY-521 (chinese clone) and a Teensy 3.1 (no chinese clone). There's an alternate i2c library for the teensy's called i2c_t3. Could that be a solution to this problem? Perhaps the following options could help? I2C_AUTO_RETRY Wire.setDefaultTimeout(timeout);  @friend the library isn't crashing per se -- it's rather the chip is crashing/misbehaving which the Wire is not made to cope with. The ""i2c_t3"" library you've mentioned looks to me like a Wire replacement for Teensy, which implements timeout and bus recovery (by pushing out 9 dummy clocks) (yes, it's the  you mentioned. As such I find it's entirely feasible to use ""i2cdevlib"" on top of ""i2c_t3"" with perhaps little modifications of the former. @friend to confirm. I cannot say for sure if your MPU6050 will misbehave (you should test it), but you must understand implications if it does. Primarily it means during a ""latchdown event"" you may lose some sample points, or at very least get them late if you're using hardware FIFO. Whether this is a problem to you depends on your application (e.g., a drone will be very sensitive to such hiccups in data). Speaking of unlatching MPU6050 with dummy clocks -- yes it works. Well it worked for me.  of course you will probably want to use shorter timeout than 1 second.  Thanks Johnny, Apparently my hangs were caused by bad connections. Since I fixed them I haven't seen them anymore. When I had them I also saw them with different (non-DMP) MPU code. When I changed that to the t3* library the hangs disappeared but I didn't receive any data either. Now busy with pid-tuning ;-) Rgdz.  Got into this issue myself today. The behavior, in this case, is all works well till I disconnect the usb cable from the board. Several seconds later it freezes. If I let it stay for a while starts working again for a few cycles and stops again, this repeats randomly, annoying  Solved, it was something I did wrong with the wiring; when I power separately the servos and arduino (with the usb cable) works like charm. Many thanks Jeff Rowberg, keep up with the good work!!  I face the FIFO overflow problem  @friend this issue is not about FIFO overflow. You may want to check if issue is not filed for your problem already (and file a new one if it isn't). Or, if you find this is the relevant issue, please provide more information. E.g., does your MPU6050 latch SDA? Are you using DMP? What platform you're on? Etc.  @friend I have to say, I highly dislike your attitude. To summarize, you have unoffcial hardware, you admitted having limited knowledge of the library you use and the I2C (TWI) protocol, you did not provide anything concerning your hardware setup and wiring and yet you insist in making claims about  i2cdevlib reliability even after numerous people, including mr. Rowberg himself, has pointed to you the potential source of your issue. Astro-Johnny scope out the faulty sequence and finaly proved that the MPU keep the data line latch low. He also demonstrated how you could unlatch the data pin by forcing clock signal.  This has nothing to do with i2cdevlib and rather is linked to flemsy hardware and TWI driver implementation. I make a living developping embedded software. This is a common issue I had with numerous sensor. The sensor get stuck in is state machine and does not complete the I2C transaction hence keeping the data line low. I have implemented multiple I2C driver for a variety of mcu and now I always implement a recovery sequence in which the mcu take control of the I2C line and bit bang is way out forcing either a stop condition or a software reset on the sensor (see any I2C protocol documentation for this). Now as mr. Rowberg told you, it would be difficult to stay compatible with arduino platforme using is own TWI driver, not impossible, but not in the scope of this library. So you are left with these two choices  Buy thrusted hardware. Fix the WIRE library.  Also I would like to remind you that this is free open-source software. No one owes you anything. If you are so certain of the bug source then fix it yourself! Best luck with that! Regards, Alex  @friend  I have to say, I highly dislike your attitude. Hundreds of people are facing the same problem, surely it's my ""unofficial"" hardware which is the root of the problem. Surely I am the curlprit.  Well if there is a bug in the firmware of the MPU and everyone is using the arduino WIRE library then yes they will all be facing the same issue so what is your point exactly? I never said you were personally responsible for this issue. I said that you make claims that you cant prove and this is rather annoying, especially when people point out the source of the issue. A word of advice, dont buy cheap hardware if you have not the knowledge nor the equipement to troubleshoot the thing if there is a problem.  @friend You dont live here in brazil, the cheap parts you buy in US are expensive here, and the expensive parts you buy in US you rarely can buy here in brazil being able to trust the seller. LOTS of brazilian are using the ""regular"" MPU6050 sold in the internet. We have no way to tell if it's good or bad stuff. And even if you pay 10x what it cost to you in US I wont be able to tell if the product was ""original""/""certified"" cause most sellers hide the origin of the products to avoid taxes.  I appreciate the comments from those vouching for the integrity of the I2Cdev library, and I also appreciate the frustration that comes from trying to use what should be a reliable device and observing mission-critical failures. However, I think this issue should be closed, or at least have the discussion locked, because it's not going to solve anything. Let me recap the findings  The peripheral (MPU-6050 in this case) is behaving in way that is disallowed by the I2C spec. This is not a bug in the I2Cdevlib code. The underlying I2C/TWI communication layer (Arduino Wire library in this case) contains a blocking  loop that assumes all peripherals will follow the I2C spec. This is not a bug in the I2Cdevlib code. It's not even a bug, exactly, in the Wire library; however, it is a missing feature.  In light of this, there are a finite number of options  Use a sensor that doesn't break the spec. This is not suitable for those who need the MPU-6050 for whatever reason. Patch the Wire library locally with the addition of read timeouts. This is possible, but it requires extra effort for each user. Also, it is strictly outside of the scope of the I2Cdevlib project. Improve the Wire library officially by implementing timeouts and submitting a pull request. This is an ideal solution, but it requires a lot of agreement from many people on the Arduino project. It too is outside of the scope of the I2Cdevlib project. Implement a custom TWI/I2C communication layer with timeout support. This could be done within the I2Cdevlib project, but it would necessarily mean than projects using I2Cdevlib and its custom TWI/I2C layer could no longer use Wire, making it somewhat restrictive. This solution would fairly be considered a new feature, not a bugfix, as it is not actually fixing any bugs in the I2Cdev code. Implement a hardware timer/watchdog to interrupt the while loop if needed. This is theoretically possible as well, but it requires using on-chip resources that are already quite scarce in order to solve a corner-case failure triggered by an outside peripheral device behaving badly. This could be added to your application logic, but I would never want it to be part of mainline I2Cdev code.  All further effort towards solving this should be directed at patching the official Wire library to include cross-platform timeout support, as this would add real value and address the pain points that many people are experiencing.

If you contact me, I‚Äôll be sure to explain more thoroughly what this project is about and the position you would be working on.  Hi! Please explain more thoroughly what this project is about. Also, it sounds like you're offering only 5% for what should be a co-founder role (easily 30%, probably halfsies, possibly more). You have this great idea, but building out a lightweight prototype that's fully functional is not only weeks of full time work, but will require constant engineering follow-through. If even moderately successful, you will NEED someone who will be committed to see it through. Think of it this way I'm going to be using many years of development experience (technically, a decade), making many of the product decisions on the fly (as is necessary in a tight working relationship with a non-technical co-founder), and generally building everything. What you will bring to the table are the skills I don't have. When you're working on a project with someone else in this capacity, you have to sell THEM on YOUR pedigree, and you need to bring value to the table. An idea is just an idea; without backing and research and a compelling story for its success, it's not even a good one. I invite you to post your resume here. The barrier to entry of being a CEO is incorporating.  Mr. Murder, thank you for your input. I am glad you‚Äôve seen through my deceptions. I am glad you actually took the time out of your day to expose my trickery. You are absolutely right. The worker (that would be you) with all the skills and knowledge should run most of the company and should earn most of the company too. In fact, the owner of the idea, the one who runs the business side of things (sole or with a team), the one who files for the company, the one has to keep the company from running to the ground, the one makes all the important decisions should MOST DEFINITELY own 5 percent of the company. Maybe less. That is exactly how all the biggest companies in the world run their businesses. If I may, I would like to suggest one last thing before taking my deceitful person to more viable candidates. Do your reserach before talking young Bill and for the love of God, please know your worth. 10 years plus in your career and you still struggling to make your big break. You just signed up on Github this past week and your first order of business is to bash the first post you see. I think we all can your bluff now...  Hi! Looks like you didn't read what I wrote, or didn't understand it. So, I'll piece by piece break down the wall of text there and explain what I'm trying to say. First off, I'm not accusing you of trickery, I'm highlighting your naivet√© in hopes that in the future you put more value on the people you're working with. Second off, there is no company. You have no company. You have an idea, and an idea is worthless without execution and followthrough. When you tell someone they'll get 5% in a 11 partnership, that is a miserable deal for what will be weeks (to months, and even years!) of hard work that in a major city earns you a salary and equity in a tco package ALWAYS north of $150k a year. You're not forming a partnership, you're bald-faced trying to fuck them. Take a look at examples of historical and modern startup equity among co-founders.  Jobs convinced Steve Wozniak to take something like 30% ownership in an early Apple. It's widely accepted that Wozniak got capital-f fucked by that. You are not Steve Jobs. By the way, you are absolutely right that's exactly how ""how all the biggest companies in the world run their businesses"". Facebook employs around 25,000 people. How many do you have? Next, there is no ""owner"" of an idea. It's an idea, unless you patent it, in which case you get about 15 years of protection (good luck patenting any variation on a social network, by the way!). There is execution of an idea. You, by yourself, are incapable of executing or else you'd be building it. I made this account as a disposable account. I hope you can appreciate why. Call me a coward, but I don't care to taint my professional reputation. I see listings like this all the time and ignore them (as many other people do), but never as vague and boldly ""I'm an idea guy"" as this. And yes, we have a term for people like you idea guy. It's derisive.  Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know why I entertain the narrow minded. If my post offended you than I beg of you to pardon my life. If you look closely at the post, under it I set out a disclaimer. I can give much detail on the post for a reason and you assuming that I don‚Äôt have a company shows the level of ignorance you have on the matter. If this post intrigues you and you want to at least know what is cooking behind the scene, contact me. My email is there. If not, find some other way to spend your time.  Balking at compensation terms isn't narrow minded. Give detail on the post. I guess it's wrong to assume you haven't incorporated; but, I would not be surprised if you haven't. Start off with some PRDs. Maybe a few slides showing a potential audience. Cometitor research. Most important of all, post your resume.

This issue has been open for over a week and unfortunately no one has had a chance to look at it yet. We get close to 100 new issues reported each day, many of which are not real bugs, but simply students having difficulty with the math. Unfortunately this means that even with the assistance of our awesome volunteers, we can't always go through and address each issue individually. Consequently, this issue is being automatically closed. If you're still experiencing a problem, please report it again! We always keep an eye on the ratio of users reporting a problem to users successfully using an exercise, so reporting a problem--even if we can't individually address it--really helps.

That is a superficial analysis because the stack it is also pointing out to 14 stacks inside MAME code. Since it's a segmentation fault and MAME it's crashing, we all know that 'something' it's trying to do an illegal read or write inside MAME memory space, otherwise it would be just bgfx's that isn't the case here, so it doesn't justify closing a legit bug report, just because. The regression comes from your commit 0bd02131b644b61088789f52f31b750c9aecaa6d before that MAME don't crash, I've just tested out. It's your commit, you implemented, so you go and you file an issue with the BGFX project.  I do not use Linux and am not inclined to fix this, particularly with your ever-abusive attitude towards people who actually contribute to this project.  0bd02131b644b61088789f52f31b750c9aecaa6d is an update to bgfx from upstream.  If it started happening after that commit, it's a regression in bgfx itself.  MAME isn't doing anything different.  I also can't reproduce this with MAME 0.208 built with clang 6 and libc++ on Fedora 28.  There must be some other contributing factor. @friend you really need to work on your attitude.

Use  or figure out why the mingw paths aren't being used by default.  I didn't file a bug for Fedora, people are aware that Fedora it's a unstable system and it is a test bed for RHEL. Anyway, this is not about Fedora. The way the build scripts are made it should be smart enough to detect what it needs from the system by it self without the need for  since there are tools available to use and depending on the system  should return the proper paths for libs and includes. The reason MAME fail to build it's because the build scripts uses a nasty hack like this one that replaces  with nothingsdl2-config --cflags | sed 'sSDL2' The correct path for SDL2 headers is Same happens on Linux, the build script uses  instead of  and it will obviously fail to compile either on Linux or mingw. The second reason why this is failing it's because there are no proper conditionals for , if we take example from  We can see  getting the SDL2 path hack, now if we look in to  This is basically it, we can't see any SDL2 configuration on either  or  for  and still don't understand why it passes  to the compiler since this is defined for . I didn't test at the time for lack of time, the regression is this 8ffff5d2d3bcebbdbefec2508ddd2ecd264a399a, removing  and  from the makefile and building with  for some kind of miracle this make it work again. And when I say ""miracle"" it's because there is nothing on the script passing the correct path for the compiler but still it compiles all the way through because even set as  it uses the bundled SDL2 from MAME when it should use the system. Do you concur?  Fedora is ""unstable"" in the sense that it's updated relatively quickly and packaged software occasionally gets a major version upgrade before a distribution update.  It isn't ""unstable"" in the sense of crashing or not working.  Being the ""testbed for RHEL"" is exactly why a lot of people use it.  It uses the same packaging system, similar network and service configuration, it's largely ABI-compatible (e.g. it uses the same versioning for FIPS-compliant OpenSSL), and it gives you a preview of where RHEL/CentOS may be going.  The benefits are huge for people who, like me, use RHEL for deployment of line-of-business applications. You're misunderstanding why it does special stuff for macOS - on macOS a system installation of SDL2 uses a NeXT-style framework, which is not used for any other target. Before 8ffff5d2d3bcebbdbefec2508ddd2ecd264a399a  and  did the same thing.  The option wasn't working intuitively.  It's not a regression that  now disables the option instead of doing the same thing as . Stripping  from the end of the include path is intentional.  For consistency between macOS and other platforms, MAME includes the  prefix when including SDL2 headers.  Hence, the parent directory is what we need to add to the include path. Your analysis is completely flawed, and the issue you're reporting is not happening for others.  @friend between this and #4789 you've shown that you don't seem to have learned anything about how now to use the issue tracker, and how not to get developers off-side.  You're getting a 6-week ban for this.  This is not the real reason your are giving a ban, it's to hide your own incompetence again, and again and we can go on and on, how many times you are gonna close legit reports to dealt with it later? This is what happens when you give a nobody like you some power, they like to show off and oppress other people, to shut people off, you are disgusting and a coward. What you are gonna do now? Delete messages like you did before? It doesn't matter the lame excuse you've gave, it doesn't change the fact that the script it's passing the wrong path to the compiler and #4789 it's breaking MAME memory space . And don't get me wrong, I know how to use a issue tracker, in an organize project, the issue it's acknowledge, tagged and dealt with latter. If you or any other dev will handle it now, tomorrow or 10 years from now, I don't care. It's a damn bug report and not a help request. Why all the drama about it, what are you afraid of?

This should work, but the  call after it seems to completely remove the ordering generated by that. For our code, the SQL generated by that code is Notice the lack of ordering clause. If I put the  after the , the SQL becomes Also note that the ancestors method and the path method do the right thing, but the descendants method and the subtree method do the ""wrong"" thing.  Ugh, actually, right after I sent that I realized that the ordering in question doesn't actually order the elements.  I guess  doesn't do what I expected.  Opened an issue  may have to put in a (temporary?) code fix on our side, because I'm not sure it's easily solvable in upstream.  Related #2481  yeah I'm going to have to add local code to workaround this issue...maybe I can do something general in RelationshipMixin / Relationship  @friend @friend What is the status of this PR?  &lt;pr_mergeability_checker /&gt;This pull request is not mergeable.  Please rebase and repush.  @friend I say we close this and fix it in ancestry or monkey patch it. ",5,0,125,0.3125,0.125,66,2,n

It looks like this is related to a change introduced with the improved algorithm in msLayerWhichItems() in maplayer.c. The problem seems to be how lines 385 and 386 are interacting with msDBFGetItems/msShapeFileLayerGetItems in that msShapeFileLayerGetItems is returning MS_FAILURE because msDBFGetItems found no items and thus calls msSetError and returns NULL. The line maplayer.c386 then causes msLayerWhichItems to fail before line 388 can say this is an expected condition. The following are the changes I made to mapshape.c (to return MS_SUCCESS) and to mapxbase.c to not set an error that isn't an error. The change to mapxbase.c may cause issues with tileindexed layers with no attributes in the tileindex shapefile failing without an error message. This depends on what the correct behavior is in another place in msTiledSHPLayerGetItems. I think this is for the tileindex not the actual data shapes, and the tileindex does require at least one attribute. If this is true and the mapxbase.c change is kept, an error probably needs to be set in msTiledSHPLayerGetItems if there are no items.

I haven't seen any in my 1.4.2 world, so they might be invisible. Chest Lid or body of chests and enderchests rendered invisible. Signs Sign rendered invisible, text remains. (Possibly only with Optifine, have not yet seen in Vanilla) I have not yet seen any Endermen, Cave Spiders, Blazes, Villagers, or Zombie Pigmen. I do not know if they are effected. (CORRECTION All mobs are effected) UPDATE After updating Java and LWJGL, the bug is not fixed but far more random. The previously effected mobs now have random parts missing. Attached screenshots. The burning effect you see is actually fully-invisible zombies burning in the sun. UPDATE 2 For reasons that I cannot fathom, either carelessness or system error, this has been marked as a duplicate of MC-61 and resolved. This is not the case. I never made any mention of invisibility potions, and this bug still exists as of 1.4.7.

That much is clearly Optifine's doing, and is why I hope Optifine will become obsolete after 1.5.

The fix is already merged, although a new release is pending. See   then, it's better to stick with Ruby 2.4.2 on Windows. The Nokogiri team removed the GEMSPEC from sources, to disallow people building from master branch, since it is unstable and probably would contain bugs.

I am wondering how this happens. Its kind of a tradition ruby makes a point release around christmas every year. the dev version was around for weeks. Ignoring Windows blames the users who are bound to this OS for what ever reason  @friend nokogiri-core is always welcoming of contributors who would like to help us support Windows. We've asked for help repeatedly over the years, as we've all got jobs that distract us from supporting open source software, despite our best efforts and intentions. I'd like to ask that you pay attention to the tone of your message above. ""Ignoring Windows"" is clearly an untrue statement, given the number of hours I've personally spent, the number of hours @friend has spent, the amount of time we've spent providing automated testing tooling for Nokogiri on Windows, etc., etc. Windows support in Nokogiri is first class. We provide precompiled DLLs for users who want a fast, simple installation; and we provide support for users who want to compile Nokogiri and libxml using DevKit. Saying that we're ignoring Windows users is absurd and a little insulting. Currently I'm blocking a release that supports Ruby 2.5 on windows on getting Ruby 2.5 supported in our test pipelines. I accept some fault for not being more transparent about this as the blocking factor. But now I'm trying to make amends by communicating exactly what's going on behind the scenes to properly support you and the platform that you use. Not ignoring you or blaming you, as you claim. I'm going to lock this issue because I really don't want to do a whole back-and-forth.

Windows Ruby 2.5 build is up and running  Note that commit bf94cf5 was added to master to make windows tests less brittle.

I forgot to add that the biggest drawback of doing it this way is that a one-time password could be invalid by the time a long running  command that does testing and installing of node_modules got to the publish step.

It's using 'cn' attribute in the login_ldap.php, which is common name, which according to the ldapwiki  do not use 'cn' names for groups, we use 'uid' for groups, along with memberUid. Changing to use 'uid' works. Time for another LDAP config parameter?  It's already user defined in the configuration screen.  No, it's not. Look at line 146 in login_ldap.php $found_dn=@$ldapResults[0]['cn'][0]; For a ldap instance using rfc2307, this does not work.  It really isn't used.

What you are suggesting whether you realize it or not is that we need to pull the list of users from each group and then check for membership on a per user basis or you're missing information from the ldap search.  Please submit a working pull request.   As I have stated countless times before - I don't know LDAP and barely got this to work with the example I managed to steal from the Google.    However, if you simply want to tell me that we're doing it wrong, that's not productive.    Working pull requests are welcome.  It's now obvious that Pig does not understand LDAP rfc2307 either. Group membership is a separate object from the user object in rfc2307, and membership is denoted using uid or the uid object (rfc2307 vs rfc2307bis). so using 'cn' to search for group membership in a rfc2307 schema fails. And no, I was not going to post the complete object in a public forum.  I understand ldap and have worked with it for nearly 20 years. I'm not bothering quoting RFCs, i'm posting the actual code and how it is working.  It isn't using the CN for searching for groups it searching for the memberof attribute or the nested DN attribute for people using openldap.  I posted the actual loop that is determining group membership.  from login_ldap.php, line 148 this code has a hard-coded 'cn' in it, so it assumes activedirectory type member changing it to 'uid' and everything works.  and when the group search fails, that loop will return nothing, because it's searching for groups based on CN, not UID in a rfc2307 schema.  By adding in an error log statement at   of something to the effect of error_log($ldapSearchDN); Then again another to show the contents of $config-&gt;ParameterArray['LDAPBaseDN'] we can take those values and throw them into the following search against AD from the values that I have said will work at this point in the code where CN is essentially doing nothing. [wilbur@friend openDCIM]$ ldapsearch -x -b ""DC=ad,DC=wilpig,DC=org"" -D ""tablesb@friend.wilpig.org"" -h 10.0.0.243 -W '(|(userprincipalname=Limited User)(cn=Limited User))' The CN value was pulled from an earlier ldap search so that we are just now matching again against a known value that was pulled from ldap and this time around we are looking for the memberof statements. This is NOT searching for groups based on CN it is actually attempting to just lookup the same object htat we already loaded again because we love to do things repeatedly.  So while you are harping on a CN value it actually does nothing.  that entire section can be removed and have no real issues. Stop quoting me RFC and read the god damned code.  1st, we do not have anything like you posted, open your damn eyes. 2nd, the ldapresults are over written  in the else statement, that then calls an for loop, that then calls the checkaccess read the GD code your self.  Start at line 128, and not that ldapResults are overwritten at line 150.  Remove lines 144 150 in your codebase.  I've read the code, I wrote the code, You clearly aren't following the logic and have some bizarre schema in your environment.  I have this code working against a standard AD back end as well as an openldap back end without any issues.  If you are doing pure posix and don't have common names defined, not my problem.  We have common names to help identify groups so we don't have to remember ID numbers.  I'm not changing the code for your self imposed issues.  So in other words, you do not support RF2307, only your self determined Schema's. Too bad.  Defined Attributes for RFC2307  some of the attributes defined in [RFC2256] are required. Further down the hole for rfc2307 we find what are the requirements for group membership.  your RFC comments in this case CN is required.  Our schema already has a 'cn' attribute in the userobject. You are the clueless one.  Look up groups under RFC2307.  They do NOT use 'cn', they use either member, memberOf, or memberUid.  These are NOT attached to the userObject at all. This is NOT active directory.  This is openldap running a RFC2307 schema.  The section of code you are looking at is pulling a user object.  NOT a group.  I've given you a work around for your issue to remove lines 144150 in your codebase and yet you are still choosing to argue about what you don't understand in the code.  I'm locking this thread.

The other container doesn't get a network stack of it's own, but uses the one configured by the openvpn-client container. Go ahead and make your own containers that do that, but you'll have to modify all containers that you use to be able to route their traffic to your openvpn container.  oooow okey but then it doesn't work for a vpn provider then.  There is then 2 usecases, the one where the vpn provider gives an ip to the container clients of the vpn container. And the one where only the vpn container gets an IP and where you need to put everything in a network and change the gateway for the client container....  I really am not following what you're saying here  which vpn did you take in your example with transmission for example?  I'm personally using PIA, but there are users that have contacted me for probably a dozen or so VPN providers, so don't think it's all that relavent.  Man, if it's impossible to talk to you then so be it but then say so directly Because if the goal is to deny everything I say while I encountered a major problem with your setup then you are loosing my time but also yours  where in all that  does it create a network stack? Nowhere... Nor PIA nor mullvad nor protonmail nor nordvpn doesn't give a bunch of addresses, they give one for each connection you make. So the containers behind if they are only in the same network stack of your openvpnclient they won't get any ip addresses  I built the container, and have been supporting it for quite a while. It's not just my personal use that I'm commenting from but how things have worked out for other users of it. This is issue number 165, I've answered and resolved to the best of my ability 164 prior question / issues that people have run into. The openvpn container does create a network stack, it's the other container that doesn't, as you stated in the first message  well apparently it doesn't do that anymore in 18.09 because if I do docker network ls, there isn't a forth network  and I don't see that you put a dhcp server in your container and as I stated earlier, vpn provider doesn't provide with a bunch of addresses. So if the docker daemon doesn't provide for an ip address I don't see how the other containers would have one  You're looking at the container connected to the VPN container, your first message references . If you are following the directions from my container you're telling docker to not create a network for that container and to reuse the one from the VPN. So when you look at the network for  there is nothing there, because it didn't get it's own network stack.  As docker won't be administering the VPN directly, I have no idea if it will show the IP address handed out by the VPN provided to the container even if you pull the network settings for the VPN container, it may well only show the docker assigned IP. I've never checked.  and that I don't see that becoming true. As I said there is no dhcp server anywhere in that, unless the vpn that your container is using is a private one where the openvpn connection act as a dhcp relay, or you attach your container to another network. And now you are telling me that the vpn is providing addresses... LOL show me where PIA is giving away multiples addresses on one connection. And no there is no ip assigned even in the container itself  I provide this container and answer questions for fun, you're being rather rude while I'm trying to help you. I'm not inclined to bother much further. I guarantee you that it is currently working for me and many others, and that I'm trying to answer your questions so that it will work for you as well.  that was rude so you were rude well before me, just saying. and again you are giving me details of your vpn container but you actually not understanding what I'm saying. And as I said, PIA gave you ONE ip and ONLY ONE because of your connection, that doesn't mean that the container which are behind this vpn container are receiving one! Gosh is that so complicated to understand?  I didn't show you the content of your vpn container on my installation. The vpn container on my build is working. I was talking about container behind that container.  No one ever suggested that all containers that used the VPN containers network stack got their own IP, I explicitly said multiple times that they didn't get IPs assigned at all.

On Mon, Dec 25, 2017 at 238 PM Neil Mitchell notifications@friend.com wrote  @friend, I understand your general point about API instability, but in this particular case it's absurd. The API change that is holding this package down (implementing the  proposal) is one that was formally proposed on the library list and formally accepted and implemented. It is not going to be reversed before the  release. Moreover, even if it were reversed, there is no downside to supplying  instances as required. It is true that the way the  instances were changed in 7e6e7b4667020b61986c60e0c2d642e700e7966d is incompatible with (hypothetically) reverting that change. Making it compatible would be a matter of adding  where required. This issue is annoying everyone; please fix it.  @friend not that the issue has anything to do with stack but ... considering the amount of work for creating and maintaining (tracking all git repo update) a stack snapshot for something that is ephemeral, I think the likely outcome is that it won't happen, lowering the amount of testing GHC alpha gets and the feedback GHC Devs gets back. Even if that stack snapshot happens, who will sweat to add this to their travis which will have to be undone once 8.4 is released ? I think if you don't use the same mechanism of delivery for everything then you're making the testing bar way too high already. Clearly if there's no release of  (and other basic packages), I don't think anyone should bother with alpha or beta releases (haskellers or GHC devs) compared to say, testing GHC git repo directly.  I‚Äôll see about getting primitive in shape in a few days.  Right now this thread isn‚Äôt helping in a positive way.  I‚Äôve locked the thread to prevent more drive by non constructive remarks. Positive reinforcement and collaboration are way more effective way to motivate folks, and honestly framing your heated remarks in terms of personal feelings or motivations would be more constructive than how some posters have approached it. Hypothetical positive remark ‚ÄúI would really like to test ghc 8.4 alpha with vanilla hackage and a release of primitive , because for structural reasons I can‚Äôt edit my cabal config in my homedir  to point to two package sources even though that‚Äôs supported.

Happy New Years all, I‚Äôm off to visit my younger sister for a week of rest.  Use positivity and positive reinforcement to motivate folks.

Now can you let an actual real maintainer (close/wontfix/ignore/resolve) this issue ? I'ld like to know if we can expect to be able to test with non-final GHC 8.4; I personally have tried many time in the past to add non final ghc to my package builds and be stuck with unreleased primitive (or other packages), just like people commenting and watching this issue.  @friend I'm not sure your comments are driving this conversation in the right direction. You might reasonably argue it's not in the place it should be, and I appreciate the temptation to vent, but let's not make that this issue. @friend This bug refers to an issue that is still open, but has now been closed. I appreciate you don't want to get into a war on a bug thread, but closing bugs without saying why confuses us who report them and want to know when they are fixed. Concretely, to answer your questions I want to test with GHC 8.4.1. I want to test using my CI. I want to test exactly the same way I've tested every GHC release up until now, unless someone offers a compelling reason that a better approach makes more sense. I want to test because people asked me to test. I want to know when the issue is fixed, and thus I want to subscribe to a github ticket. I want to know if you plan on fixing this in the next week or so, only once GHC 8.4 is in Beta/RC1, or at some other point - so I can plan what I do in response. I am grateful for the work everyone does maintaining the infrastructure and packages, this one included üòÑ  This isn't every ghc release until now -- it is an early alpha release, which is a new thing, part of a new release process  libraries were released in conjunction only with the candidate phase of a release. The new process was not intended to also have more libraries released for the alpha phase. Rather, the overlay package index is currently the recommended way to deal with it, as per  this wasn't the case, we'd potentially have a ton more package releases, a number of which would not be particularly compatible with any properly released version of GHC. This new alpha ghc release is uncharted territory for everyone. As per the announcement this is way earlier than normal -- the fact that we can test with it at all is forward progress. As such, this isn't a bug. It is a disagreement over the new alpha release process. Those who want to weigh in on the alpha testing process should probably do so on the ghc-devs list.  I've been tested with GHC HEAD for many years, and releasing packages to Hackage specifically to deal with GHC HEAD. To me, the process still hasn't changed (although I appreciate it has to the rest of the world). If the decision of the primitive maintainers is to not release until GHC goes into Beta, that's fine, but the resolution of this ticket should be ""Open"" and the comment should be ""We'll fix it when GHC goes into Beta, if you disagree email ghc-devs"".  Except... I think that the changes are already in HEAD of  -- there's just no release cut? i.e.  Yep, then the bug is ""No released versions work with the unreleased GHC 8.4"". Concretely, GHC 8.4 has compiled binaries, and I'm testing it on my CI. I have taken action to say released primitive is not working. When that stops being the case I need to undo that action. I want to ""watch"" something, so a ticket is mightily helpful for that. I imagine when primitive does release to Hackage then @friend and @friend are going to also take some action (e.g. additional testing, reverting workarounds etc).

But what if there is no particular exception you want to catch, but when you just want to do some cleanup before propagating any exception? Using  isn't an option here, since we want to reuse the resource on success, and only clean up on failure. I could just explicitly catch  instead, but there is no indication in PEP-8 that this is preferable (otherwise why would bare except be supported in the first place). So How about suppressing E722, if there is a  statement in the  block?  Using bare except for resource closing is a common behavior, especially when I implement context manager. The check of  should be changed to .  The error code E722 was implemented in #592 / (#579) and I warned about it but sigmavirus24 wasn't interested and told that I did not read the whole thread....  To be clear, pycodestyle doesn't do look-ahead's so we cannot silence this if there is a  in the following block. That's just not how pycodestyle has ever worked and it would require a significant rewrite to enable that kind of behaviour.  Quoting the PEP As a general rule, this new check is good. There are specific cases where people will need to do general clean-up work, as described above. Since we cannot check for people re-raising the exception in the except block, it truly is up to the user to determine whether  This check is useful to them at all or whether they feel it should be ignored globally Their particular use of a bare  is necessary and it should be ignored in that particular case (e.g., with  or ).  I would hazard a guess that 90% of pycodestyle's users will find this check worthwhile, useful, and helpful. We can not ever satisfy 100% of our users so I am happy to settle for 90%.  I have two (real world) scenarios  Legacy code, initially written by novices, with inappropriate use of bare except all over the place. E722 is helpful there, somewhat since this usually isn't the only issue in such legacy code, and you en up ignoring most errors there anyway. Code written by me (and similarly experienced Python developers), where bare except is used occasionally, but never without re-raising the exception. For reference, E722 is reported inappropriately three times in this project of mine.  If the design of pycodestyle doesn't allow considering the following block, in order to avoid inappropriate errors, my understanding is, that due to the potential of false positives this check should not be enabled by default, or such a check should rather be implemented in pyflakes which considers the AST and therefore is able to ignore bare excepts that re-raise the exception. I'm not going to clutter my code with  comments. IMO the purpose of a linter is to help you writing cleaner code, not to require additional boilerplate for legit practices.  I'm not sure if you're intentionally ignoring my suggestion to include it in the  list for your projects or if you just want to try to argue. Either way, I'm not here to argue with you. Pycodestyle is a tool used by novices and experts alike. Novices will learn from this and so will some experts. Since this is a style tool, there will always be places where some people disagree with the checks and will disable them. That's normal. Just because a handful of folks object to a rule doesn't mean we will put it in the  list even if generally speaking it has value for everyone else. As for the suggestion that pyflakes entertain a style check, you can make that argument to them, but that is typically entirely against their philosophy.  I just hit this as well. In my experience false positives can have a damaging effect. I've seen novices commit naive ""fixes"" for correct code. I believe this issue will cause novices to rewrite what I wrote to which will of course leave temporary files around in the case of KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit. This check needs to see the raise, or be better worded, to steer people away from naive fixes.  That's kind of a bad example though because you should be using  to clean up resources. It could lead to novices getting a ""wrong"" idea, I agree, but they're already doing it wrong in the first place.  No, as in @friend's example, this is not an unconditional clean-up. In the happy path the file gets moved into a permanent location.  I'm with @friend on this one, but I'd take it a little further  a bare except is inherently unpythonic.  Two important parts of python philosophy () are 'Explicit is better than implicit' and 'Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.'. I point these out because a bare except is a special, highly implicit case. Every other  has an 'argument', indicating the scope of the error to be handles.  Even if that's 'everything', it's better to explicitly state that. 'There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.' also applies, since you can accomplish the same thing for the low-low price of 14 characters.  That's simply not enough of a 'savings' to make it worth it. There's also the fact that things like KeyboardInterrupt aren't caught by  for a reason.  Those represent very exceptional cases - cases which shouldn't occur in normal (e.g. production) operation unless something has gone very wrong or the user is explicitly requesting an immediate shutdown. In regards to @friend's use case Why do you want to clean up those temporary files in every possible exception case?   tells me that you don't know what exceptions may be raised.  In those (hopefully rare) cases, your app will certainly crash (unless you have a bare except that silences every possible exception, but that's really bad), and you will need to investigate why.  A temporary file is part of the state of the application at the point in time, and therefore will be forensically valuable. If you know for sure that the temporary file will be forensically worthless, then  or  makes that clear, and indicates that you're fully aware of the implications.  If you're more worried about old temporary files accumulating in some way, consider having your app do cleanup as part of initialization.  That idea comes from the Crash-only software pattern (It's a lot more reasonable than it sounds, I promise).  Basically, it's a lot easier to assume that your app always terminates unexpectedly and code against that than to handle unexpected termination as a special case (i.e. Turning off the power is guaranteed to be an option, but a shut down command may fail or be unavailable). As a last resort, there's always .  If you absolutely must break from best practices, then 8 characters is a very small price to pay.  @friend I appreciate the support. This sounds like you're assuming all development is on continuously running applications on a remote server. Things like pycodestyle and flake8 are ""production"" applications that should handle . That said, both projects handle it explicitly. I think I understand your point, but it feels like it's imposing a false dichotomy around what is ""production"". I can imagine a few cases where @friend would want to (and should!) clean up the temporary files. Perhaps those temporary files contain some sensitive information and cleaning them up is the secure thing to do. In reality, neither of us know the details and I think we should be assuming that they know their constraints better than us. Of course having some non-sensitive temporary files lying around can be useful for debugging, but there are certainly valid cases where those shouldn't be left around no matter what exception happens.  @friend I think you're right re imposing a false dichotomy - I'm primarily a web developer, where the dichotomy is pretty reliable. In regards to temporary files containing sensititive information, Wouldn't it be a risk to write them to disk at all?  If the power is shut off at the right moment, the data would still be there on disk, and no exception handling would have a chance to clean it up.  So that makes me think that a temporary file is the wrong tool in the first place.  I'd want to keep that in something volatile (like memory) so that it's sort of fail-safe. You're more general point is a good one. - We can't know the real requirements on a project we're not a part of.  But if those requirements do require a cleanup in all exception cases, I think we probably agree that it should be done explicitly.  Again, there are constraints where it makes sense. I agree with you in general, but there are always exceptions to the rule. Also we're getting off topic smile  doesn't mean the same thing as  in Python 2; in Python 2 you could raise old-style classes as exceptions, which do not inherit from BaseException. Regarding ""I could never imagine a situation where I'd want to unconditionally clean up in the case of any exception""  In the case of temporary files, never leave them around on a production server because they can cause additional impact (eg. filling a disk volume) which can be much more serious than the original crash. Reproduce the issue in dev and diagnose. Just came across another example in the case that my event loop crashes due to programming error, I must kill my subprocesses which are now in an unknown state code.   @friend I'll admit that there are some cases where  is the right call, but they're cases that pycodestyle isn't intended to handle out of the box.  Marking those with  might seem a little cluttery, but it's much more helpful to those same junior devs who would be confused by the error.  It explicitly indicates a code smell that is a necessary evil.  Ideally, you'd document why it is necessary as well so that they understand why the exception had to be made. So to go back to your initial comment, Pycodestyle isn't designed in a way that it can detect the raise, so that's a non-starter.  As for steering novices away from naive changes, that's the purpose of code review, not linting. A better solution is to prevent them from even knowing about it in the first place though, hence  and documentation.  Or evidence that this check needs to be moved to Pyflakes, which does consider the AST, in order to eliminate this false positive. In a large organisation that is impossible. Junior people are often two or three steps removed from people who could confidently tell you what good practice looks like. We rely on linters to do this, and both the false positive and false negative rates are important. I'm not saying I'm not worried about the false negative. I'm arguing that this creates an undesirable false positive. You're assuming I'm writing code now for future novices to read. I'm concerned about the novices now maintaining the code I wrote 5 years ago when this check wasn't a thing.  PyFlakes wouldn't accept this for the very reason that it's so controversial. They only accept obvious problems, e.g., unused imports. If this isn't satisfactory here, a different stylistic option for having it would be via a Flake8 AST plugin. Luckily,  already provides this check using the AST but a quick check of the source indicates that it's as strict as this check is. I'd suggest either collaborating with bugbear or creating a new plugin that meets the specific needs. As it stands, this discussion seems to be getting heated. I'm going to lock the thread because it's devolved from constructive conversation to far less productive conversation. ",63,8,360,0.2727272727272727,0.45454545454545453,176,5,y

Only saw it happening for Safari and Chrome browsers.  What is the reasoning behind the deep equality check? Per the React docs...

Perhaps a bit cleaner than using the props method above.  @friend not sure how that could speed up  in   @friend Sorry, that was a reference to the  error and presumably  - not anything perf related.  @friend this error happens because ReactHelmet compares props with deepEqual and when there are children in props it iterate over children as well and since those children are React components (not a plain objects) it simply overflows the stack. The workaround is to avoid providing any children to  component, but anyway, deepEqual is still bad.  So, I don't see any reason why  needs a  prop  @friend Gotcha! Well in that case,  solves the problem because deepEqual never gets called in  as the component re-mounts instead of updating. Hence, no stack overflow. Was very useful in my case.  Hm, interesting. Do you have a link to read more about re-mounts of keyed elements?   when the key changes it tells the reconciliation algorithm that the element in the new tree is different from the element in the old tree. If the new key isn't in the children in old tree, a new component is mounted. If the new key was in the children in the old tree the element will be re-used.  Aha, you mean that you have to update that key on every render.  Yep, that seems faster than deepEqual, but still not quite clean as fix deepEqual or avoid children.  Well, you only have to update the key when the underlying children change. In my case that happens when that particular view URL changes, but you can use any string representation. Maybe someone has a react-router match.params change which updates the title or meta information - that'd be a good spot to use  IMO. Anything where state affects the children.

While the error reported when SPFx attempts to load the Web Part appear initially to be an SPFx issue, investigation has identified that the  property which is the root cause of the load failure is from react-popper, and is related to the webpack warnings issued when generating the full output for the web part. As far as I can see, this is because webpack is assuming the reference in react-popper's  file loading the 'real' popper.js is in fact a reference to the same file. Do you have any suggestions which will allow react-popper to be successfully consumed by webpack? Note that I cannot change away from webpack as this is an integral component of the SharePoint Framework.  @friend having done a lot of experimentation, I strongly believe that this issue needs to be re-opened. Ultimately, the combination of packages that I'm using (SharePoint Framework, React, React DOM, Reactstrap, FontAwesome and others), require that the webpack resolver modules paths contains , without this in the path for example it is absolutely impossible to include a FontAwesome icon in a Reactstrap button, because react throws errors that are not thrown otherwise. The ultimate fix is to use another name for your  file so that conflicts aren't an issue - changing configurations when those configuration changes are breaking changes for many other packages and package combinations isn't appropriate.  I find it so difficult to think that you are the only one having this problem honestly... If enough people report this we can think about a solution. Until then, I'm convinced the problem is on your side.  @friend If you looked at the linked issue over at the SharePoint Framework side in my original report, you would see that I'm not the only one with this problem; and that it's not unique to my combination of packages.  Sure, people might not be reporting it directly here, but that's because they're indirectly consuming your package via npm's version of dependency hell, not using it intentionally or knowingly!  It's still a problem of the sharepoint configuration, I mean, I don't even know what it's it, but if it happens only with it there must be a reason I guess? How do you expect me to change the name of a file used in the library just because your configuration is trying to import stuff from where it's not supposed to?  So, instead of carrying out a relatively straightforward fix on your side which not only would resolve this issue but also prevent the same issue with the hundreds / thousands of potential package and configuration combinations out there, stopping lots of other developers falling into the same trap - often (as in this case) completely outwith their control, you opt to disown the problem and put it upon every potential consumer of your package to solve instead? I have no direct control over the SharePoint Framework configuration; I'm just a consumer of that set of packages. I have no direct control over how Reactstrap works, I'm just consuming that package, I have no direct control over FontAwesome, again, just a consumer here. I have no direct control over React ... guess what?  Yup, a consumer! I shouldn't even have to care about all of that; especially as I'm not directly consuming react-popper - it's buried deep in a set of dependencies I also have no control over. Surely it's a more 'customer focused' approach to just resolve the problem with the name conflicts than it is to force a mere consumer of packages to play piggy-in-the-middle between multiple projects, all the while wasting time and making no progress on their own projects?  If I gave an answer such as yours in my day job I'd soon not have a day job - so why is it OK for you to do so just because this project is open source?!  I know I may be a ""weird"" person to talk to, but my point is We may fix the problem with  renaming that file, and everybody would be happy and would go to get drunk and sing in the streets, but tomorrow some other package will make the same mistake, and everybody will be sad again. Is this where we want to go? About all the day job stuff etc, if you are willing to pay me my hourly rate I'll be happy to show you all my professionality üòâ  How about we balance your hourly rate with the several hundred hours I've already expended on this problem at my hourly rate?! Or, better yet, how about you spend the 45 seconds it would take you to fix the issue!  I'm taking care of the problem here, for free. ",24,1,350,0,0.5,326,21,y

Just to clarify -- we run these tests with the development build right?  Yeah this seems reasonable. I'm sorry for the pain. I'm however unsure how rollup would solve this as people will use the dev code (react/lib/*), not the production build when writing unit tests.  Yes, we run tests with development CommonJS build. Rollup would solve this because we can move requires back to the top of the file (like Jest prefers) but it would still eliminate dead code in prod. Browserify is not that smart which is why I inlined them, but I won't have to after switching to Rollup.  oh, yeah, that makes sense!  Okay, this should work, right? This is getting super hacky. üò¢   This should work in FB because  should give  as it‚Äôs an unknown global. This should work in CommonJS because  should give whatever your bundler gives you, and we don‚Äôt care whether it exists or not thanks to the same check. This should work in our UMD builds because we don‚Äôt use  anywhere except those  checks so it‚Äôs safe to force Browserify to use  there. Our  clauses still work because they get envified.

We received a payment that is showing up on  but not on our node  Yes The smallest publicly available ledger is not 0 but 32570. That set aside, about 5 TB. You likely won't be able to use HDDs as a back end to rippled though, querying a historic ledger creates hundreds of thousands of random reads all over the database. SSDs typically can respond to a few thousand or tens of thousands of  these per second, HDDs are more in the tens to hundreds range.  @friend The response to account_tx will always tell you which ledgers it queried over. Unless a server is seriously misconfigured, this should be 100% reliable. If the account_tx says is queried from ledger X to ledger Y and is a complete response (no marker for continuation), it should always include every relevant transaction in those ledgers. I would suggest you only try to keep a month or two of history on your node. In the rare cases where you need more history, you can query s2.ripple.com. That's a best effort service with no promoses, so I wouldn't point any live systems at it. But it's available if you need more history than your own servers, or the s1 cluster, hold.  Thank you for the help. Our Ripple node is currently using 14.6GB of RAM, is this normal usage? üòÆ  That's a bit high, but sounds about right if you were querying historic data and not just validating. 14.6 GB is not the highest by far I've seen on my node, so I'd call that medium usage.

Test sequence  Create new VM ""testy-tahir"", install 14.04 from ISO, install emacs.  Follow instructions [[wikidoc/RPKI/Installation/DebianPackages]] for trusty (apt-key, rpki.list, apt-get update, apt-get install).  Edit /etc/rpki.conf.  Only change needed was adding , to tell Django's cross-site-scripting protection to shut up and accept that name.  , as a check that GUI is up.  .  Asked me the usual questions, just worked, no exception.   Logs of most of this available, but they're pretty boring. So I don't know what you guys are doing wrong.  If I had to guess, I suspect you did not really start clean even though you say you did, eg, at some point you were using an rpki.conf from some other machine (with different SQL passwords) and did not clean up fully when you decided to back that out and try again, which left you with a mismatch between rpki.conf and the passwords in MySQL.  But that's just a guess. Trac comment by sra on 2015-08-06T145841Z  polluted machine not likely, as we would destroy old vm, create new vm from a prototype that had never hear of rpki. though we did carry the rpki.conf around.  and it had that long auto- generated shared_sql_password {{{ shared_sql_password             = wOnoHHYNfhec7-Gm2SJ5e_PxBkniAjA6NNrlqq2LeDyXJsRbswlCJbOUPw4FAqnUdn9THR-4x0nagTbdtoG-1X4C shared_sql_password             = di2lbEw51 }}} but we dug ourselves out of this one.  so it is no longer blocking. Trac comment by randy on 2015-08-06T150618Z  Attempting to create the database when it already exists is supposed to fail by default, to prevent you from blowing away your precious existing data by mistake. There are options to change the default behavior,  for details. Trac comment by sra on 2015-08-06T151420Z  Nope.  Just the config file, and whatever MySQL believes at the moment. ‚ô†rpki-sql-setup --fix-grants` may be useful if you want to force MySQL to believe whatever you have in the config file today.

After the kodi request is approved becomes this cleaned up and changed in one commit.  @friend is this style also for you OK?  The header paths seems like a regression. Why include kodi in them? And that nasty .. hack is also a bit poo  The hack is really poo, complete right. Currently there to have still old addons compatible. I have never, never liked the way before with a e.g. . This is normally a include of a own header on own sources for me. The other reason to have  folder before is to prevent in future include problems. As example comes ""Filesystem.h"", if now a  is used can a addon developer not use as own header with this name, with  no problem. The old header name style with a xbmc or kodi before is for me in case with much more headers not so good. The next where it is really good to have as ""&lt;&gt;"" is the auto completion during write of code.   use of quote or angles is completely orthogonal as such. the only meaning is which is tested first (quotes mean check source directory, then include paths, angles the other way around). i'm just tired of the never-ending dance back and forth. i did like you did it, then it was changed to what is now with rebranding ease as the reason.  Has asked on slack to others, this has accepted it with @friend @friend @friend and @friend. I think there comes again the discussion like several years ago but what you think, do we try it?  As long as there is no reversal again it is all good for my sake. But if we do this and have to change it again i will go loonie tunes ;) @friend is not on the list u mention, he will have an opinion on this.  Well, this will make rebranding a lot more difficult. It means addons won't build against a fork without sed-ing the includes. And the hack is ugly as shit. Anyway I'm not a addon maintainer, so feel free to ignore if all relevant devs agree.  For me can a fork with other name stil use ""kodi"", with the current header names is this already present. I understand that some forks or complete another Softwares want to use the addons, but with the current header names is it already fixed to ""xbmc"" or ""kodi"", this becomes removed and the folder name used as alternative. The only difficult part can be if someone develop on Kodi and on a fork that it use the same path, but to hold Kodi's addons compatibel with him must he already use equal headers.

Am I missing anything?  @friend does the login on your local work fine?  @friend Yes it worked fine when deployed them on my local  That's really strange. Can I see the full error as it shows in the console?  @friend just wondering, how secure is running this command? Would anyone - and I mean anyone be able to deploy to an S3 bucket if they know what's the bucket's name?  @friend In this case they need your AWS credentials to upload it. So as long as you are not giving those out, you should be fine.  This guide is incredible, thanks for all the hard work! I'm having an issue with the production build deployed to S3. Everything works fine locally and deployment isn't an issue, but when I go to my S3 URL to load the application I get the following error in console Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property 'call' of undefined     at t (main.a20f4176.js1) Based on the the issue link below, I assume its something to do with webpack. Any chance you have an idea of how to fix it? Haven't been able to figure it out myself.  incorporated a couple additional things to your guide redux, react-redux, react-router-redux, redux-thunk, redux form and some babel/eslint stuff. Link to my test repository below, would really appreciate any help or thoughts.  Once I attempted the aws s3 sync command here, I realised nothing was being written to my s3 bucket. After a little reading I realied that my admin IAM user didn't have PUT access to that bucket, so I amended the bucket policy to the version I've provided below. Hopefully this helps someone out in the same situation. Otherwise an absolutely smashing tutorial here guys. Amazingly thorough and I've learned loads in just a few short hours. Cheers.  @friend Thanks for the kind words! And thanks for reporting back. I'm sure it'll help some folks.  when trying to sync I received this message a couple of thing I don't understand  what is this ?prefix=&amp;encoding-type=url why s3.Frankfurt.amazon while up to now all regions where in the form eu-central-1? As a matter of fact I don't know where to start troubleshooting... if someone can help...   Ok, so maybe this can help somebody else. I created the notes-app-client folder inside the notes-app-server. I thought it should inherit the login credential but it didnt, so I simply reconfigure awscli with a new accesskey and secretId.  Don't forget to use  when uploading if you have profiles otherwise you will get  Hi all, everything was working fine until I run npm run build... I'm using babili instead of uglify... The build is complete, but when I run the project I get this error Uncaught (in promise) TypeError h.a.config.credentials.getPromise is not a function Does anybody have an idea of what's going wrong? Thanks in advance for helping.  @friend I'm not too familiar with your setup so I can't really help. But maybe somebody else can.  Hi, I created my S3 bucket and went to do npm run build and I deployed the build/ file to the S3 bucket I created.  In AWS the bucket shows up with all the files created in the build file, however when I go to the endpoint, the url where my app should be live, it shows up with the favicon icon but the screen is blank and the error i get from the console is  Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) main.f5cd3d98.js Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) main.0e9b8740.css Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) I understand that it is not reading the static files created during the build but I cannot seem to figure out how to fix this error? Hopefully someone can help me please? Thanks )  @friend Can you ensure the permissions for the S3 bucket are set right? Thor CORS and permission section in this chapter -  @friend I manage to get it working ! So thank you for the help )  Should maybe add --delete to ‚ô†aws s3 sync build/ s3//YOUR_S3_DEPLOY_BUCKET_NAME --delete` So that the changes don't accumulate. Before I did that, earlier versions were buffered and the correct version was not always rendered.  I'm getting the following response, ""npm ERR! missing script build"" What can I do to address this?  I figured it out -- I ran a few of the npm install scripts in my root directory as opposed to my working directory. never mind!  Is this example SEO friendly? If yes which part helps to be seo-friendly. If not how can we make it so? I'm a quite newbie on serverless and react, so please be kind if my question looks silly )  @friend No worries. We might have addressed this somewhere else. But the notes app is a single page app and it is not meant to be publicly accessible (it's behind a login). So it isn't really SEO friendly. Are you wanting to remove the login and make it publicly accessible?  Hi @friend, I'm planning to build a mortgage comparison website. Yes it will be publicly accessible. I was thinking to build it with a similar stack as in this example. But I am not sure if google bots will be able to read the content of my pages and index it so people can find it when they search the words like 'mortgage calculator' ...  @friend Google does handle JS for SEO but a better pattern for this is to use a static page generator like Jekyll for your landing pages. And then use React for your actual app. This way you get to create content for SEO purposes while still having a single page app. For example this tutorial itself is in Jekyll (for SEO purposes) and the demo app is in React.  @friend Thank you very much. I'll test it for my website.  This issue was moved to  This issue was moved to ",23,0,219,0.125,0.5,200,22,n

shlink/shlinkio/210,0.06093983,shlinkio,shlink,failing installation // PHP Fatal Error: InstallCommand.php:90,4416,44,119,0.8,0,"Trying a fresh install, getting this error. Afterall I think the installment is (based on the previous issues) way to user unfriendly. Maybe should think about an installer that also checks the needed additions, as said in #152  // or make the install readme more detailed. By saying ""Setup the application by running the  script."" it first confused me, too, and took me half an hour until I figured out this is not really an installer but more of an commandline enhancer to install/compile the script. Anyway, back to my problem It was throwing out the error befor and after I installed the required APCu. So I have no idea what is stopping the installation. Sys  CPU | Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2680 v3 @ 2.50GHz (6 core(s)) Version | Plesk Onyx v17.8.11_build1708180301.19 os_Ubuntu 16.04 OS | Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS PHP 7.2.10   I'm afraid that error means you are not really using PHP 7.2, but 7.0 or older. That's why it does not get ""void"" as a reserved word, and instead it tries to load it as a class. Many people has faced this problem before. Make sure you run the installer with the proper PHP version  I freshly set up a host with a fresh 7.2 php install. My server has 7.0.30 as lowest php installation and the package I am using for shlink is using 7.2.10 FPM, should I maybe use 7.2.10 FastCGI?  It might be that you are using the proper version from the web context (the fpm), but not from the command line. You can check by running php -v   There you have the problem. It's PHP 7.0  I'm on it. If I get it running, let me check if I can get it to work now.  Okay, this form of installation is honestly the worst I have ever experienced. I love the product, really the best link shortner I've ever used but the installation, you really have to fix that, it took me 2 hours in general to even make the installation starting with all preperation without the knowledge of a certified sysadmin. I am very sure that the extreme lack of user experience of your installation process is the man key factor your awesome programm isn't far spread. Now that I got your installation running, it only needed my one single type to f* over the whole installation and letting me redo the whole process after removing it all again. Short I got it working, but please rework your installation process, it is horrible. Great product anyway.

You have probably noticed this software is completely free of charge, which not only includes the software itself, but also some support from my side, and the will to implement missing features and help as much as I can. However I work on this on my free time (mostly weekends, vacation periods and a few hours from Monday to Friday), which means there's always going to be missing things and parts that can be improved. It's easy to spot what's not working, what made you waste two hours of your time. What's not that easy is being able to see what's actually working (I have ""wasted"" hundreds of hours on this, but you are welcome). In the future you should learn some manners when dealing with free and open source software maintainers, and remember that they don't work for you. Any constructive feedback is always welcome but not like this. ",9,3,242,0,0,223,1,y

One of the fields is UserID. When the user enters a computing ID the cellEdited event is triggered and it makes a call to the server to lookup the rest of the information if the UserID exists. Pretty standard. If the user entering the data types in the UserID and presses 'Enter' or clicks on the next cell everything works fine. When they press 'Tab' to move to the next cell they get an unhandled exception and the data doesn't update. This is only happening on Chrome. Tabulator Info  Which version of Tabulator are you using? Post a copy of your construct object if possible so we can see how your table is setup  To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior  Create a table with data entry cells (input type) Have one of the cells call out to the server and load the row with data when it gets filled. Enter data that will trigger a row fill Press 'Enter' to confirm everything is working Repeat step 3, then press 'Tab'  and see the error.  Expected behavior I expect the cellEdited callback to work the same regardless of how the user exits the cell.

"" sdrausty/termux-archlinux#12  @friend Can you post exact steps to reproduce a problem with ""busybox tar"" instead of posting links to various issues whose problem may have a different source ? Or we should debug TermuxArch to find where problem occurs ? For me, at least, there no problem with command  that you posted  So there some possibility that TermuxArch script is faulty or your user did something wrong. Busybox has a relation to ecj or java ? That's something new for me...  @friend  then uncomment  comment out  . Busybox tar does not complete untarring as expected; See referenced issues above.  @friend Exact command - is a command without a script, for example . I posted result of executing  above  Command is identical to specified in your script ( is identical to ). Where incomplete ? In your script maybe. But running standalone command successfully ends without any error. Okay, I will check your TermuxArch script as you suggested, but I'm 97% sure that there no problem with busybox's tar.  @friend I did this, but I don't have any problems...  Successful installation   Successul execution of 'startarch'    Ok, there signal 1 generated, but are you sure that it is from tar ?  @friend a little info about machine is requested.  Are you using the latest Termux packages?  Yes, latest packages. Machine AArch64, Android 8.0. About  - i try to found where it occurs.  When  is used, there is no signal 1 generated.  @friend I just removed your 'spinner' from 'preproot' function and error disappeared. I'm currently doing a verification installation of TermuxArch - if error fixed i will post screenshots.  @friend this might trigger the error.  And if so, why only with Termux busybox tar?  TermuxArch was reinstalled successfully 1.     3.   There may be a some kind of 'race condition' since you running a tar job in background.  - this may be a trigger, i'will try to remove output redirection and see what will happen.  Thanks for the update, a race condition... @friend Can you post a snippet of how you redirect ouput to find out more?  @friend The source of error is   The problem is that .  Just to summarize  works without issues as shown on screenshot  assumes that source of several errors in TermuxArch is  without proper debugging.  Perhaps we shouldn't accept issues that occurs in third-party project or those, which does not have a proper PoC to reproduce errors/bugs. (Templates are solution ?)    I do not assume anything @friend To continue this line of debugging Termux  should be checked;  and system  behave well.  Termux  behaved well until recently, just like . How shall Termux grow if issues regarding Termux Packages cannot be brought up here?  @friend I checked it in the first my post in this issue ! You didn't see ? Busybox tar even don't print errors and exited with status 0. Nothing that command  has exit status 0 which means success ? I don't see TermuxArch in termux-packages repo and never seen. It also don't available in main repos via  and don't mentioned as project of Termux organisation ( from third-party packages shouldn't be posted here (in termux-packages). For these we have a Google+ page and Gitter. =============================== @friend I guess this issue can be closed, we can reopen it later if  really has a bug.  @friend  Package request termux-arch was closed; Are there valid reasons for it to become a package? Then why does it trigger a signal when the others do not?  @friend bsdtar triggers signal aswell for me =) This error happens randomly. There two possible situations that may happen in your code  tar finishes before  this will fail since job 1 does not exist  tar finishes after  this will finish without error   Remember don't run parallel shell processes if you don't know how to properly control them.  I cannot use it.  Neither can Termux users that want to try TermuxArch.  BuildAPKs is in a similar state with the latest Termux Package ecj.  Random errors in Termux are very concerning; This is not the first report. This IS not the case with , and this was NOT the case with Termux busybox tar until last week when things broke; See initial post.  @friend  - By looking at this I'm very unsure that you properly test your scripts... Some posts above you wrote that this is not in case with . But bsdtar still produce the same behaviour as busybox's tar. I have finished... No more posts from me in this thread. I point you from where error comes - but you ignore, ok...  @friend thank you for your time in this matter.  Your insight and instructions are appreciated.  There are no errors with bsdtar.  Just like there were none with Termux busybox tar until recently.  As I have mentioned before, your opinions of me are yours.  It would be great to hear a compliment rather than complaint from you btw.  @friend I am looking at this matter closer thanks to our discussion. It appears that even on the device throwing random errors,  consistently work verses Termux  BusyBox .  I shall be looking in why this occurs in more detail‚Ä¶  Closing then since there's no problem with termux's busybox tar.  For those of us who would like to continuare  Termux  triggers signal 1 of these three options; Any ideas why?  I have heard the point about , this is un'importante.  For those of us who would like to continuare  is a quicker way to check this than cloning the entire repository.  Only Termux  triggers signal 1 of these three options (Termux ,  and Android system ); Any ideas why? I have heard the point about $? in spinner(), this is un'importante‚Ä¶   I must disagree with your biased hair raising conclusion; Sorry to dissent. I disagree  Pardon my English @friend, what you wrote is bullshit.  I would like to know the answer to this straightforward question.  I must disagree with your biased hair raising conclusions; Sorry to dissent. I disagree with your opinions wholeheartedly.  I must disagree with your biased hair raising conclusions; Sorry to dissent. I disagree with your opinions wholeheartedly (learn to punctuation properly, then maybe we can talk).  Does anyone have any idea why just Termux busybox tar generates signal 1?  @friend study initial post;  many users have posted this error to us.  Why do you promote the Wikipedia article only to delete?  @friend you have asked me to promote Termux at Wikipedia, and you delete our efforts at Google+!  Why?   Is this (Termux projects fail) what you want @friend?  Is this (Termux projects like   and  fail completely) what you want @friend?  I cannot work with people (groups) that entice me to contribute it (worse; wot submission), then delete; Sorry.  How is your PhD coming @friend?  You asked me to promote Termux at Wikipedia, only to delete our efforts.  Why did you do this @friend? (Answer is not forthcoming afais)  @friend You reacted with a laugh emoji; Is contributing to Termux only to see your contributions deleted (run afoul), really funny as you stated with your laughing emoji?  @friend You reacted with a laugh emoji; Is contributing to Termux only to see your contributions deleted (run afoul) really as funny as you stated with your laughing emoji?  Both  and  are down with the latest Termux updates.  This is not funny @friend.  It's a headache for me to keep these projects running while I get, ""broken because it's NOT Termux"" from you and our PhD candidate.  @friend You reacted with a laugh emoji; Is contributing to Termux only to see your contributions deleted (run afoul) really as funny as you stated with your laughing emoji?

Why did you do this @friend?  Straightforward question to @friend, probably without reply.  Can someone answer why they encourage something only to delete it?

tern-lint/angelozerr/39,0.089088223,angelozerr,tern-lint,Support AngularJS Dependency Injection (multiple signatures),1786,24,17,0.2,6,"When using both the  and the  plugins for  and using strict dependency injection I get warnings about invalid parameters. Example code I get the following linter warning Not sure if this is an issue with the  plugin or the  plugin or both. I found the  type info in the  plugin here  marijnh/tern  tern/plugin/angular.js #L405  It would be nice if we could figure out a way to make functions with more than one signature work properly though. I can't really use the  plugin for any of my large projects until this works.  @friend I understand your problem. At first I have forked tern angular from marijnh/tern  tern/plugin/angular.js #L405 for AngularJS Eclipse  to improve it and to get list of directives, controller. See  problem is because tern doesn't provide the capability to declare several type for the same function. I think to resolve this problem a custom !lint should be developped for angular. It was in my scope to do that. I must just find time to do that.  @friend, thanks for the additional information (and confirmation about typing in marijnh/tern). I just wanted to make sure that the issue was reported. I think I can workaround most of this for now by removing the DI Arrays from my source code and add a build step to put them back before minification / mangling.  @friend I'm workinh on again about my fork of tern angular. I have created the project at  and I'm writing tests (I would like to have a lot of tests). I think your lint problem is not difficult to fix it. It should be really cool if you could create an issues per problem (with a sample) at  will fix it. After that you will able to copy/paste  in your tern/plugin/angular.js I have the attention to contribute to official tern plugin with my fork.  @friend fix was very easy  (multi parameter) ",11,0,53,0.2,0.6,35,1,n

Similar problem (when you can only locate the new version in your path) could happen when the old kernel module is still loaded but the new version of the userland is used.

BTW, I also tried gcc 7.3 on gentoo-sources-4.18.10 (different machine) and the compile worked fine as well.  Thanks for replies. About zfs binary stopped working I know, it is because I compiled a new version of zfs and still use old version of zfs-kmod. I am using this kernel for a long time and compilation of zfs worked well always. My last successful compilation was about 4-6 commits ago to the master. I read this link about grsecurity, but didn't found a solution. Also, I don't see any grsecurity errors at dmesg while compiling. So now I have new zfs and old zfs-kmod and I am afraid to reboot, I don't know how to compile the same version in gentoo or back-forward for some commits. I think the problem is related to some new code in last commits, the kernel version or gcc version.

Thanks!  Hi, I just saw this. I will let someone know so a PR can be opened, meanwhile I had some other fixes written for a few other spots that need testing.  @friend I was about to send some patches in, including this one, but apparently someone with oper rights in the channel was feeling like a primadonna and decided to issue a ban over hurt feelings related to a comment about the semantics of the word 'mostly'.... after PMS'ing around other folks. Did not seem like someone technically involved in the project, but he went ahead and did the same in -social. Therefore, odds are you did not get a message in the channel mentioning another issue that is present with the spl debug code (without further analysis it looks like misuse of snprintf(), leading to a single byte leak, but I haven't verified this proper). Holding on to the patches for now.  @friend  if you have patches, submit them. but name calling and hostility won't be tolerated even if you have patches to submit to the project. in your comment here, you decided to continue with hostility and name calling. it's a pattern you have exhibited for time, and a few users decided enough was enough. no one else complained about the loss. please behave professionally, and I will do the same.  This is long overdue, this project needs a code of conduct.  Eh, after reviewing that other issue where someone is calling for a Code of Conduct (which is a fairly dumb idea), I'm surprised to see that you assumed that person was me (perhaps the intention of the troll all along). Since this begs finally some proper attention, I will describe this issue (feel free to remove the comment later as you obviously are seemingly easily to have your feelings hurt regardless of whether the other person intended so or not...). I'll just clarify a few things I've never asked for help in the channel and treated someone ""poorly"". I responded ironically to ptx0's messages, after he spent the past few hours being dismissive or condescending to other people, obviously in some cases users with a very limited skill around ZFS, but that does not merit acting like an imbecile. None of them were insults or hostile, they simply pointed out that ptx0 was assuming things constantly and then replying with an air of arrogance and usually in a condescending tone, despite himself being far from a beacon of excellence as far as technical skill or coding go. Immediately after he proceeded to ban me from the channel, to which I responded in -social pointing out that his attitude and actions making him look puerile and petty regardless of the nature of the ""offense"" by someone else. This knee-jerk reaction came motivated more by petty personal sentiments (and sharing those with some others who, well, fit that profile) than any actually reasonable reasons. Now, on the project you are routinely accepting patches quite obviously without really doing your due diligence, ensuring proper QA, etc. Case in point, the one we have here. It's painful to see that you waste more time on petty nothings over actually making your code or merged patches look like something with a modicum of technical quality. The control over whether contributors are just copy-pasting from other spots (hint licensing violations get people sued), if the patches actually conflict with major kernel features, or symbol exports, or..... is lacking all over the place. How about instead of making up half-truths about people offending your feelings, or your buddies' feelings, you go and properly benefit from the resources you so adamantly defend (and ask others to work with) How difficult was it to grab the patch I sent you from the link, test it, test it again, sign it off and merge it? You need to go around deleting comments and engaging in conversation with the other troll, but you are too busy to actually merge an out of band patch while you waste time over petty fights? Well, good luck with that. And you are surprised ZoL is not taken seriously anywhere but by the homelab/non-enterprise crowd. If you want to be a primadonna, at least have the cards in your sleeve to back it up you can't justify it right now with the standard you are providing your users. And it runs in ring0, so go figure a better way to fend off all those users popping up on IRC asking about destroyed data because you merged a patch from a pull-request that would not stand a moment in the LKML.  I am temporarily locking this thread.  If I could please ask everyone to calm down, I'm not about to pick sides in whatever conflict that is currently taking place here.  Brian has asked for someone to submit a PR to fix this issue.  Until that takes place, there is no reason for this issue to remain wide open given its current state.  I had no idea who it was. that seems unnecessary. perhaps you were being unintentionally abrasive, as you were in the previous sentence where you imply I have easily hurt feelings. I'm sure you didn't mean to do that, right? then you can see how easily words can be misunderstood. however, more than once have you come and ask for input (maybe not ""help"", exactly) and then were rude to the people who were asking you for more information. criticising how they were attempting to help you. we are volunteers who want to help others. we don't want to deal with difficult people. bans aren't permanent, they can be removed.. sometimes bad things happen in life and we need to respond to them appropriately. people are known to have bad days. coming onto the issue tracker and claiming to withhold your help because of an unrelated incident is not an appropriate response to being banned from an IRC channel. I'd been curious who I'd abused so horribly that day and went back and found this I couldn't find any instances of being condescending or dismissive of any new users, though I did help save someone from redoing hours of work and then warned them about a potential issue. this is a part of a pattern of language from you that we have grown tired of. why do you think it's okay to call others imbeciles? who are you talking about? who is ""they""? I couldn't find this conversation. where did it happen? alright, it may have been a knee-jerk reaction. if you'd messaged me to work it out, things probably would have been Just Fine. interpersonal differences can be worked out, everyone in the project wants the same thing. the ZFS test suite is  very new  and has many deficiencies. testing every possible scenario is, as you must be aware, the impossible task. if you've found problems with the process, raise them specifically as new issues so that they can be addressed. I haven't seen anything until just now, but you don't raise any specific issues or offer any solutions, which seems less than helpful. but a lot of it has simply been spent waiting for a PR to be opened. if you're seeing it happen, why didn't you step up and submit one? is it because of the fact you've pointed out in the past that you consider our contribution process on github to be ""for hipsters"" and something you are essentially too good for? if you have any improvements you see you can make, please do so. otherwise you're just insulting the members of the project, again. any license violations should be raised with the project and fixed. can you cite any specific cases? I don't know what you're talking about. it should be easy to find cases where this is true if it's ""all over the place"". is it too much to ask you to not be rude to people when they give you advice? to not come on here and then insult everyone else's work - people who weren't even involved in your quarrel? for what it's worth, I'm not the one who's responsible for merging patches - there is but one gateway for this project to have patches merged. I can review, test, ask for changes, but that's where it ends. Brian is the one who merges the changes. I have to propose a corollary  to your question. how difficult is it to open a pull request? you mentioned back in early December you were going to open one. I deleted your comment here that only served to insult me and hold your PR hostage. if you don't want to submit the PR, don't - other users can do it when we find the time. it's a cooperative effort. you don't care to be a part of the project in the way we've required, and so your patch doesn't find inclusion. is this surprising to anyone? observation I don't know how long it took you to write your own comment here but it seems like you could have opened a PR in less time. this is another example of your pattern of disrespect. ""You are surprised""? who? not taken seriously? that'd actually be news to... well.. most of us, I imagine. I'm not sure I quite follow. you've seen users reporting data loss with a released build? would that be v0.7.10 that we marked as On Fire shortly after release and that was never included in any distribution? maybe an  related data loss back in 2013 from AIO write path errors? but that was never in a finished release. it might actually be helpful to have a list of data issues that ZFS has had in the past, similar to CVEs.  The discussion in this thread (now hidden) has not been productive.  In the future, please speak respectfully to fellow contributors.  @friend and I are working on putting a process in place for handling inappropriate behavior.  In the mean time, please feel free to contact either Brian or I privately if you have concerns about the behavior of ZFSonLinux community members.

I think we need to operate under the assumption that they're not going to export the functions, and just disable the vectorized versions of the checksums if  are not detected.
